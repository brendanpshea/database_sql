        "\n",
        "Database normalization is the process of structuring a relational database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. Let's review what each normal form requires:\n",
        "\n",
        "### First Normal Form (1NF)\n",
        "- Each table cell should contain a single value\n",
        "- Each record needs to be unique (typically through a primary key)\n",
        "- No repeating groups or arrays\n",
        "\n",
        "### Second Normal Form (2NF)\n",
        "- Must be in 1NF\n",
        "- All non-key attributes must be fully functionally dependent on the primary key\n",
        "- No partial dependencies (where an attribute depends on only part of the primary key)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Third Normal Form (3NF)\n",
        "- Must be in 2NF\n",
        "- No transitive dependencies (where a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute)\n",
        "- Every non-key attribute must depend directly on the primary key\n",
