        "# Views and Common Table Expressions in SQLite\n",
        "### Database and SQL Through Pop Culture | Brendan Shea, PhD\n",
        "In the world of database management, presenting and manipulating data in a way that is both efficient and secure is of utmost importance. SQLite, a lightweight and versatile relational database management system, offers two powerful tools to achieve these goals: Views and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).\n",
        "\n",
        "Views are virtual tables that allow you to encapsulate complex queries and present them as a single, reusable entity. They provide a way to simplify data retrieval, aggregate information, and control access to sensitive data. By creating views, you can hide the complexity of the underlying tables and provide a more user-friendly interface for querying data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common Table Expressions (CTEs), on the other hand, are temporary named result sets that exist within the scope of a single SQL statement. They offer a way to break down complex queries into smaller, more manageable parts. CTEs can be thought of as temporary views that are defined within a specific query and can be referenced multiple times within that query.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this chapter, we will explore the concepts of Views and CTEs in SQLite using a real-world dataset related to music. We will be working with data from Rollingstone and Spotify, focusing on albums that appeared in any version of Rollingstone's greatest albums of all time list. (This is a greatly expanded version of the data we introduced in the previous chapter). Through practical examples and step-by-step explanations, you will learn how to create and utilize Views and CTEs to effectively present, aggregate, and secure your data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whether you are a beginner or an experienced SQLite user, understanding Views and CTEs is crucial for building efficient and maintainable database solutions. By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid grasp of these concepts and be able to apply them in your own projects. Let's dive in and unlock the power of Views and CTEs in SQLite!"

        "-   The primary keys (`artist_id`, `album_id`, `track_id`) are strings rather than the more commonly used integers. Spotify likely uses string identifiers because they are **globally unique identifiers (GUIDs)** and can be generated independently across different systems or databases without the need for coordination or central allocation. This allows for better scalability and distributed data management. These sorts of keys are common in **distributed databases** that live on multiple computers, and have large numbers of concurrent users.\n",
        "-   The `genres` column in the `artists` table contains a list of genres associated with each artist. This indicates that an artist can belong to multiple genres, providing a more comprehensive categorization. The genres are stored as a comma-separated list within square brackets, resembling a JSON array format. This structure allows for efficient storage and parsing of multiple genres per artist. However, we'll need to be careful when writing SQL queries to access this.\n",

The presence of multiple ranking columns suggests that the rankings have evolved over time, and the dataset captures these changes.\n",

        "-   `view_name`: This is the name you assign to the view. It follows the same naming conventions as tables.\n",
        "-   `AS`: This keyword precedes the SELECT statement that defines the view.\n",

Examples of PII include names, email addresses, phone numbers, Social Security Numbers (SSNs), financial account numbers, and more.\n",

        "## Types of Views and When to Use Them\n",
        "\n",
        "SQL supports three types of views: default views, temporary views, and materialized views. Each type of view serves a different purpose and has specific use cases. Let's explore each type and understand when to use them.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Default Views\n",
        "\n",
        "Default views, also known as simple views or regular views, are the most common type of views in SQLite. They are created using the `CREATE VIEW` statement and are stored in the database schema alongside tables. Default views are dynamically updated whenever the underlying tables are modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "CREATE VIEW view_name AS\n",
        "SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
        "FROM table_name\n",
        "WHERE condition;\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Example use case: Suppose you have a music streaming application that allows users to browse and listen to songs. You can create a default view called `Song_Info` that combines relevant information from the `Songs`, `Albums`, and `Artists` tables. This view would provide a simplified and user-friendly interface for querying song details without exposing the underlying table structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Temporary Views\n",
        "\n",
        "Temporary views, also known as ephemeral views, are created using the `CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW` statement. They are stored in a separate temporary database and are automatically dropped when the database connection is closed. Temporary views are not persisted in the main database schema and are not visible to other database connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW view_name AS\n",
        "SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
        "FROM table_name\n",
        "WHERE condition;\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Example use case: Imagine you are building a reporting dashboard for a (one-time) music festival. You need to generate various reports based on ticket sales data, but you don't want to modify the original tables. You can create temporary views to perform complex calculations and transformations on the ticket sales data specific to each report. These temporary views will be isolated and won't affect other parts of the application, or be storied after the music festival is finished.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Materialized Views\n",
        "\n",
        "Materialized views are a special type of views that store the result of a query in a separate table. Unlike default views, which are dynamically updated, materialized views are refreshed manually or on a scheduled basis. They provide a snapshot of the data at a specific point in time and can improve query performance by avoiding the need to recompute complex queries each time they are accessed.\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "-- doesn't work in SQLite!\n",
        "CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name AS\n",
        "SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
        "FROM table_name\n",
        "WHERE condition;\n",
        "\n",
        "-- Refresh the materialized view\n",
        "REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name;\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Example use case: Consider a music analytics platform that generates reports on artist popularity based on streaming data. The platform needs to perform complex aggregations and calculations on a large dataset of streaming logs. To improve query performance, you can create a materialized view that pre-computes the popularity metrics for each artist. The materialized view can be refreshed periodically (e.g., daily or weekly) to update the metrics without recomputing the entire dataset each time.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that SQLite does not have built-in support for materialized views. *Instead, you would simply need to create another table and \"copy\" in the data). However, this is supported by most \"enterprise-scale\" DBMSs, including Postgres, MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.\n",
        "\n",
        "When deciding which type of view to use, consider factors such as the complexity of the query, the frequency of data updates, the performance requirements, and the specific needs of your application. Default views are suitable for most common scenarios, while temporary views are useful for session-specific data isolation. Materialized views, although not natively supported in SQLite, can be simulated to improve query performance for complex and resource-intensive queries."

        "## Modifying Data in Views\n",
        "\n",
        "In SQLite, views are read-only by default. This means that you cannot directly perform `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations on a view. Views are essentially stored queries that retrieve data from one or more tables, and they do not store data themselves. However, you can drop views using the `DROP VIEW` statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason why views are read-only is that they may not always contain all the necessary information required to modify the underlying tables. Views can be created based on complex queries that involve joins, aggregations, or calculations, making it ambiguous or impossible to determine how to propagate the changes back to the original tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, in certain cases, you can overcome this limitation by using triggers. Triggers are special database objects that automatically execute a set of actions in response to specific events, such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations on a table.\n",

CTEs provide a way to simplify complex queries by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.
