        "In this chapter, we'll be introducing some basic SQL functions for dealing with numbers, dates, strings, and NULL values in SQL. The functions here are all part of **ANSI Standard SQL**, which means they should (mostly) work with other relational database systems, such as PostGres, MySQL, Oracle, or SQL Server. For this lab, we'll be using **PostgreSQL**. Along the way, we'll also be introducing some fundamental concepts related to database security and data privacy.\n",
        "\n",
        "To help us apply the concepts, we're going to work on a (ficitonal) case study inspired by Tony Stark (\"Ironman\") of the Marvel Universe.\n"

        "As we venture into the world of SQL, we are not alone. Joining us in this expedition is none other than the genius billionaire playboy philanthropist himself, Tony Stark. Just as Tony Stark employs a multitude of technologies to aid in his superhero endeavours, we too will be harnessing the power of various data types in SQL to manipulate and analyze our data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This chapter takes an in-depth look at working with different types of data in ANSI standard SQL, focusing on mathematical operations, string manipulations, and handling null data. We will be exploring the principles of order of operations, column aliases, and calculated columns. Using these principles, we will then delve into creating sophisticated queries and perform complex operations, unlocking insights about superheroes and supervillains from the vast Marvel Universe.\n",
        "\n",
        "To give context to our exploration, we have a single table database curated by Tony Stark himself, compiling details of the heroes he has worked with and the villains he has faced over the years.\n",

A NULL value in SQL signifies that the information is unknown, not applicable, or deliberately left empty.

        "In SQL, single quotes and double quotes have different uses.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Single Quotes (''):** Single quotes are used to enclose string literals, which are sequences of characters, such as text and dates.  For example, when you're inserting a new row into Tony Stark's `SuperEntities` table, you might use a query like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "INSERT INTO SuperEntities\n",
        "(EntityID, EntityName, FirstAppearance, PowerRating, IsHero, Notes)\n",
        "VALUES\n",
        "(22, 'Ant-Man', '1962-01-01', 7.5, TRUE, 'Ant-Man can shrink in scale while increasing in strength');\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this query, 'Ant-Man' and 'Ant-Man can shrink in scale while increasing in strength' are string literals, so they're enclosed in single quotes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Double Quotes (\"\"):** Double quotes specify identifiers, such as column and table names. This is especially useful when identifiers are case-sensitive, include special characters, or are reserved keywords.  Let's say, for some reason, Tony Stark had a column named \"Power Rating\" (with a space) in his table. To reference this column, he would need to use double quotes:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "SELECT \"Power Rating\" FROM SuperEntities;\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Double quotes preserve the case of the identifiers as well. So `\"power rating\"` and `\"Power Rating\"` would refer to different columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that the usage of quotes may vary based on the SQL dialect (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.). For example, MySQL uses backticks (`) for identifiers, and allows both single and double quotes for string literals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, to include a single quote within a string enclosed by single quotes, you typically use two single quotes (''). For example, 'Tony''s Suit'. This syntax helps SQL distinguish between a single quote used as a string delimiter and a single quote used within the string."

This typically happens when you try to combine two different types of data, like an integer and a float.

For example, the power rating of a newly discovered superhero might not be immediately known, resulting in a NULL value. Similarly, the first appearance date of a lesser-known villain might be unclear, leading to a NULL in the `FirstAppearance` column. Therefore, a NULL doesn't mean the absence of a value but instead denotes that the value is currently unknown or not applicable.\n"

        "Tony Stark, the genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, thought he had mastered SQL. But one day, while running a particularly complex query on his Postgres database, he realized he didn't quite understand how the magic happened under the hood. So he did what any smart person does when they don't know something - he reached out to someone smarter. That person was none other than Lunella Lafayette, a.k.a Moon Girl, the smartest person in the Marvel Universe.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Moon Girl, I need your help. I thought I knew how SQL works, but I don't understand how my queries get executed in PostgreSQL. Can you explain it to me?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Moon Girl smiled. \"Of course, Tony. Let's start with a high-level overview, and then we'll dive into the details.\"\n",

        "1.  Parsing - Shuri's Vibranium Mining\n",
        "\n",
        "    Moon Girl began, \"The first step in executing a SQL query in PostgreSQL is parsing. It's like Shuri mining for Vibranium. Shuri identifies and extracts valuable Vibranium ore (the SQL text) and breaks it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Similarly, the PostgreSQL parser takes the SQL text and breaks it down into the smallest meaningful units, called lexemes. Then, it checks if the lexemes form a correct SQL statement. The result is an abstract syntax tree, a tree-like model of the query.\"\n",

        "2.  Semantic Analysis - Reed Richards' Reality Check\n",
        "\n",
        "    \"Once we have our abstract syntax tree,\" Moon Girl continued, \"we need to ensure that everything in the query actually exists in the database. That's the job of the semantic analyzer. It's like Reed Richards, who checks if his theories and inventions are feasible in the real world. The analyzer verifies if the database objects referred to in the query exist and are accessible.

        "In the context of Tony Stark's operations, database security is of paramount importance. Tony, as Iron Man and as the owner of Stark Industries, a global technological powerhouse, handles a massive amount of data that's sensitive and critical to both his company's operations and to the safety of the world.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the range of data Tony would need to manage. There are blueprints and specs for his Iron Man suits, Avengers battle strategies, confidential research and development data, proprietary technology details, employee records, financial information, and even databases containing vital intelligence about super-villains and threats to global security. This sensitive data is not just commercially valuable; in the wrong hands, it could pose a severe threat to global safety and security.\n",
        "\n",
        "The risks are myriad. An enemy could use stolen designs to build a counteracting weapon or even duplicate an Iron Man suit. Financial data and personal employee information could be used for corporate espionage or personal blackmail. Proprietary research could be stolen, setting Stark Industries back years and costing it its competitive edge. Most importantly, if villains got access to the Avengers' databases, they could predict and counter their strategies, or exploit the personal details of heroes for malicious intent.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, imagine if a villain got access to the Avengers' strategic plans. Not only could they counteract them, but they could also set traps, endangering lives. Similarly, if confidential schematics for the Iron Man suit were to fall into the wrong hands, enemies could replicate or counter the technology, creating chaos and potentially putting Tony Stark, his allies, and global security at risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a world where technology and information reign supreme, a breach in Tony Stark's databases wouldn't just be a corporate catastrophe. It could potentially disrupt world peace and put lives at risk, including those of our beloved heroes. That's why it's absolutely crucial to secure his databases. Just as the Avengers don't underestimate the importance of a strong defense in battle, neither should we when it comes to database security."

        "## Threats to Database Security\n",
        "\n",
        "In the dynamic landscape of cyber-security, databases like those of Tony Stark face a slew of threats. Let's delve into a few key ones:\n",
        "\n",
        "### SQL Injection:\n",
        "**SQL injection** is a code injection technique that attackers use to exploit vulnerabilities in a web application's database query software. They \"inject\" malicious SQL code via user input fields, tricking the application into running unauthorized SQL commands.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a Stark-related scenario, imagine a villainous hacker like Baron Zemo, savvy and patient, discovering a vulnerability in the web interface of Stark's Avengers' operational database. He could craft a carefully disguised SQL command that, instead of simply retrieving the login page, additionally dumps the contents of the 'AvengerMembers' table. This could give Zemo access to sensitive information such as the real identities of Avengers members or their last known locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "A real-world parallel is the infamous 2016 attack on the electoral databases in the U.S., where SQL injection was used to access the records of around 200,000 voters.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Denial of Service (DoS)\n",
        "In a **Denial of Service** attack, the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet. This is usually done by flooding the target with superfluous requests to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.\n",
        "\n",
        "Within the Marvel context, imagine Ultron launching a DoS attack against the Avengers' communication network. If Ultron can overload the system with useless traffic, then the Avengers can't communicate, leaving them disoriented on the battlefield.\n",
        "\n",
        "An example from the real world is the 2016 Dyn attack. Dyn, a company that controls much of the internet's domain name system (DNS) infrastructure, was hit by a massive DoS attack that took down major websites like Twitter, Netflix, and CNN for a short period."

      "source": [
        "### Malware\n",
        "Short for malicious software, malware is any program designed to cause harm to a computer system or network. A rogue genius like Doctor Octopus might develop a malware designed to infiltrate Stark's databases, specifically targeting the blueprint archives of Stark Industries. Malware is often delivered by some form of **social engineering** (which involving \"tricking\" users into installing it, for example, by **phishing** emails).\n",
        "\n",
        "One form of malware that has gained notoriety in recent years is **ransomware**, where the attacker encrypts the victim's data and demands payment to unlock it. In a real-world example, in 2017, the WannaCry ransomware attack affected numerous organizations worldwide, including hospitals, encrypting their data and demanding a ransom.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insider Threats\n",
        "Not all dangers come from the outside; sometimes, the threat is from within. This could take the form of a disgruntled employee, like Aldrich Killian from Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM), who might seek to sabotage Stark's databases out of revenge or competition. He could use his knowledge of system security and set up to evade security controls and access (or change) sensitive data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our world, one of the most notorious examples of an insider threat is the case of Edward Snowden, who, in 2013, leaked classified information from the National Security Agency, revealing numerous global surveillance programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dictionary Attacks\n",
        "This kind of attack involves trying all the entries in a pre-arranged listing of values, typically derived from a dictionary of commonly used passwords. In Stark's world, a character like the Vulture, savvy with technology salvage and reuse, might attempt a dictionary attack to gain unauthorized access to Stark's databases.\n",
        "\n",
        "The LinkedIn data breach in 2012, where a hacker was able to crack the hashed, unsalted passwords of nearly 6.5 million users using a dictionary attack, shows how potent this method can be in the real world.\n",
        "\n",
        "These threats highlight the paramount importance of implementing robust database security measures, not only for Tony Stark but for any organization dealing with sensitive and valuable data. A sound understanding of these threats enables us to better devise and apply preventive strategies."

        "Database security is an amalgamation of measures that are used to protect databases against compromises of their confidentiality, integrity, and availability. With Tony Stark's array of data, from the mundane to the highly confidential blueprints of his Iron Man suits, applying robust security measures is necessary. Let's delve into the means and tools at Tony Stark's disposal:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Encryption:** In essence, encryption is the process of converting data into a code to prevent unauthorized access. For Stark, encryption could mean the difference between keeping his Iron Man suit designs safe or seeing them fall into the hands of his enemies like Mandarin. In the real-world, many database management systems (DBMS) support various encryption methods to protect data at rest and in transit.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Access Controls:** Stark wouldn't want every employee of Stark Industries to have access to all his files. This is where access control comes in, determining who gets to access what data. Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) allows Stark to assign roles (like \"design engineer\" or \"HR staff\") and limit their access to only the data necessary for their job.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Secure Backups:** If Loki were to wreak havoc and somehow delete all of Stark's data, having secure backups would ensure Stark can restore his databases. Backups should be regular, comprehensive, and stored securely off-site. This approach also helps in scenarios like hardware failure, natural disasters, or data corruption.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Regular Audits:** Regular audits involve systematically reviewing systems to ensure compliance with security policies and procedures. By auditing his databases, Stark could spot any irregularities or security breaches. He could verify who's accessing the data, when, and what changes are being made. This might be particularly important if, say, an insider like Aldrich Killian started behaving suspiciously.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Firewalls:** Firewalls act as a security guard between the Internet and Stark's internal network. They inspect incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules, blocking or allowing traffic accordingly. A well-configured firewall can shield Stark's databases from numerous cyber threats.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** These are tools or software that monitor network or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations. An IDS could alert Stark if Whiplash were attempting to break into his systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  **Regular Software Updates:** Regularly updating DBMS software ensures that Stark's databases benefit from the latest security patches and feature improvements. It's a relatively simple measure, but it can be effective in preventing attacks that exploit known software vulnerabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Security is a multifaceted, ongoing process. Tony Stark, with his resources and intellect, would understand the importance of employing a combination of these methods to keep his databases secure. Just as in the real-world, data is one of the most valuable resources, and it deserves robust protection."

As Stark Industries and the Avengers operate across the globe, Tony Stark must navigate a complex landscape of international privacy laws and regulations. Let's delve into some of these regulations:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\n",
        "Let's say Tony Stark is considering opening a new Avengers facility in Europe, and in doing so, he's collecting data from potential European employees. One of them is Pietro Maximoff, better known as Quicksilver, a citizen of the fictional Eastern European country of Sokovia. Quicksilver, worried about Stark having his personal data, exercises his right under GDPR to limit what data Stark Industries collects. Tony needs to comply with this request, proving that his intention to collect data is justified and absolutely necessary for the employment process.\n",
        "\n",
        "The GDPR is a European Union regulation that took effect in May 2018. Its main aim is to give individuals more control over their personal data and to unify data protection laws across Europe, regardless of where that data is processed. The GDPR imposes strict rules about what information can be collected, how it should be stored and used, and the rights individuals have regarding their personal data. It requires:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Stark must ensure he has a legitimate reason to collect Quicksilver's data and can only gather what is necessary for the employment process. This is known as **data minimisation.**\n",

        "2.  If Quicksilver requests it, Stark must tell him what personal data they have on him, why they have it, how long they'll keep it, and who else might see it. This is the **right to be informed.**\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  If Quicksilver finds something wrong with his data, Stark needs to correct it. This is the **right to rectification.**\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  If Quicksilver decides he no longer wants Stark to have his data and there's no good reason for keeping it, Stark must erase it. This is the **right to be forgotten.**"

Any company dealing with protected health information (PHI) must ensure that all the necessary physical, network, and process security measures are in place and followed. This includes healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, along with their business associates who might be dealing with such information.\n",

This might include technical measures such as encryption and physical measures like restricted access to records. This is known as the **Privacy Rule**.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. If Wanda requests, the facility must provide her with a copy of her medical records, and in certain circumstances, amend them if she thinks they are incorrect or incomplete. This is the **Right of Access and Amendment.**\n",

        "## Database Security Best Practices\n",
        "Database security best practices are crucial for safeguarding data, and for Tony Stark, with his multitude of sensitive information on superheroes, villains, and cutting-edge technology, these practices become even more critical. Let's discuss some of these best practices:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):** This principle suggests that a user should have the minimum levels of access necessary to perform his/her job functions. In Tony's case, not everyone in Stark Industries or the Avengers should have access to all the data. For instance, Peter Parker (Spider-Man), an intern at Stark Industries, should not have the same access privileges as Pepper Potts, the CEO.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Regular Updates and Patches:** Keeping the database software up to date is critical to preventing security breaches. Many software updates include patches for security vulnerabilities that have been discovered since the last version of the software. Tony, with his tech-savvy suit, would be more than aware of the importance of keeping systems updated to stay one step ahead of foes like AIM (Advanced Idea Mechanics) who are always looking for a tech loophole to exploit.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Monitoring and Logging:** Regular monitoring and logging of database activity can help detect any irregularities or suspicious activities in real-time. If the Mandarin attempts another cyber attack similar to the one on the Stark server in \"Iron Man 3\", real-time monitoring could help detect and counter the attack more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Secure Development Practices:** Ensuring that the applications interacting with the database are securely developed is another crucial step. This includes preventing SQL injection attacks where an attacker could input SQL queries to manipulate the database. Considering Stark's playful rivalry with Ant-Man (a master infiltrator), Tony might use him to test the system, ensuring it is well-guarded against such breaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Data Encryption:** Encrypting data, both at rest and in transit, is another best practice. This would render the data useless to anyone who might intercept it or gain unauthorized access. Given Stark's valuable data, such as the 'Super Solider Serum' formula or 'Iron Man' suit blueprints, encryption is a must to keep these out of the hands of people like Baron Zemo or Justin Hammer.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Regular Backups:** Regularly backing up data ensures that in the event of a data loss or a ransomware attack (imagine a scenario where Loki or Ultron holds Stark's data hostage), the data can be restored with minimal disruption. Given Tony's habit of destroying his lab, regular backups are probably already on his checklist!\n",
        "\n",
        "By following these best practices, Tony can ensure that his database remains secure and robust, ready to stand up against any threats it may face, whether they be from this world or beyond!"

        "| Calculated Column | A column in a query result that consists of data derived from one or more existing columns in a table. For example, creating a column that combines first name and last name columns in a customer database. |\n",
        "| Column Alias | A temporary, alternate name assigned to a column in a SQL query for readability and convenience. For example, renaming a column 'first_name' to 'First Name' in the output. |\n",
        "| Modulus (%) | An arithmetic operator that returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, '10 % 3' would return 1, as 3 goes into 10 three times with a remainder of 1. |\n",
        "| Cast | A method to convert one data type to another. For instance, 'CAST('123' AS INT)' converts the string '123' into an integer data type. |\n",
        "| NULL | A special marker used in SQL to indicate that a data value does not exist in the database. For example, a missing salary entry for an employee in a company's database would be marked as NULL. |\n",
        "| SQL Injection Attack | A code injection technique that attackers use to insert malicious SQL code into a query. For example, adding 'DROP TABLE Customers;' into a user login field in a web form. |\n",
        "| Denial of Service (DoS) | A cyber attack where the perpetrator seeks to make a network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services. For instance, flooding a company's server with requests, making it inaccessible to employees. |\n",
        "| Malware | Any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network. For instance, a malicious program sent via email that infects a system upon opening. |\n",
        "| Dictionary Attack | A method of breaking into a password-protected computer or server by systematically entering every word in a dictionary as a password. A classic approach to gain unauthorized access to a system. |\n",
        "| Encryption | The process of converting data into a code to prevent unauthorized access. For instance, a company might encrypt sensitive customer data to prevent it from being read if intercepted during a transfer. |\n",
        "| Role-based Access Control | A method of regulating access to computer resources based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. For instance, a company could ensure that only HR staff can access employee records. |\n",
        "| Database Logs | Files that keep a record of the activities or events that occur in a database, like transactions, for later analysis. For instance, an administrator can check these logs to see when certain changes were made to the database. |\n",
        "| Database Audit | A process of reviewing operations performed on a database for security, compliance or optimization purposes. It can help detect anomalies and potential security breaches. |\n",
        "| Firewall | A network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It's the first line of defense in network security infrastructure. |\n",
        "| Intrusion Detection System (IDS) | A device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. For instance, an IDS could alert system administrators to multiple failed login attempts. |\n",
        "| GDPR | A regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. |\n",
        "| Data Minimization | A principle of GDPR that asserts organizations should only collect the minimum amount of personal data needed for its purpose. For example, a retailer should not collect a customer's date of birth when only an email address is required. |\n",
        "| Right to be Informed | An individual's GDPR right to know what data is collected, how it's used, how long it will be kept, and who else might have access to it. |\n",
        "| Right to Rectification | An individual's GDPR right to have inaccurate personal data corrected. For example, correcting a misspelled name in a customer database. |\n",
        "| Right to be Forgotten | An individual's GDPR right to request their data be deleted when there's no compelling reason for a business to continue processing it. |\n",
        "| HIPPA | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, a US law designed to provide privacy standards to protect patients' medical records and other health information. |\n",
        "| Privacy Rule (HIPPA) | The Privacy Rule establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information. It gives patients more control over their health data. |\n",
        "| Principle of Least Privilege | A computer security concept in which a user is given the minimum levels of access necessary to complete his/her job functions. For example, a customer service representative might only have access to a customer's contact info and purchase history, but not their payment details. |"
