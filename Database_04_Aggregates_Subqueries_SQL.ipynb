        "# Aggregate Functions and Subqueries With Goodreads Data\n",
        "### Brendan Shea, PhD\n",
        "\n",
        "In our last chapter, you learned the basics of SQL. You learned to use SELECT, FROM, WHERE, LIKE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT clauses to navigate a data universe. You asked questions to your database, and it responded. In this chapter, we'll explore SQL in more depth, focusing on aggregate functions and subqueries. In the process, you will uncover the deeper capabilities of Structured Query Language (SQL), finding yourself evolving from a database enthusiast to a capable data wrangler. With this newfound knowledge, you'll be able to retrieve insightful data, analyze complex patterns, and explore the unknowns hidden in your datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "This chapter introduces you to the dataset of Science Fiction books from Goodreads. We will dissect this dataset, identifying various data types and understanding the concept of null values. As data scientists, we will also reflect on the purpose of our data, setting the stage for more complex queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we advance, you'll be introduced to the magic of aggregate functions. COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG---these are not just random words but powerful spells that will let you crunch numbers, identify trends, and answer questions you never thought a database could resolve. You'll learn how to count books, sum ratings, find the highest or lowest value in a column, and compute average scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we'll delve into grouping data using the GROUP BY clause. Imagine sorting the universe of Sci-Fi books by author, publication year, or average rating. With GROUP BY, you can see patterns and trends in your data subsets, making extracting meaning and insights easier.  We'll explore further with the HAVING clause, filtering groups to narrow down our data galaxy to only the most intriguing constellations. This will allow us to answer more specific questions and perform more detailed analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we approach the end of our chapter, prepare to dive deep into the world of subqueries. A query within a query might sound complex, but fear not! We'll break it down into manageable pieces, showing you how to use subqueries in SELECT, FROM, and WHERE statements. With this powerful tool in your SQL toolkit, there are no limits to the questions you can ask your data."

        "## Why Sites Like Goodreads Use Databases\n",
        "IN this lesson, we'll be using (publicly available) information released by the Amazon-owned Goodreads (https://www.goodreads.com). This is a popular book review and recommendation platform with millions of users worldwide. It serves as a rich source of book-related data, offering details such as book titles, author names, publication dates, ratings, reviews, and much more. But why and how does Goodreads, and by extension its users, benefit from using databases?\n",
        "\n",
        "At its core, Goodreads is a data-driven platform. It provides readers with personalized book recommendations, allows users to track their reading, and enables them to discover new books based on their preferences and those of similar users. None of this would be possible without a robust and efficient data management system. That's where databases come in.\n",
        "\n",
        "A database allows Goodreads to efficiently store, retrieve, and manipulate vast amounts of data. Here are a few specific ways in which Goodreads benefits from using a database:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Data Organization: Databases provide structured storage for the immense amount of data that Goodreads deals with. For example, the information about books (like title, author, publisher, etc.) can be stored in one table, while user data (such as user ID, name, reading history, etc.) can be stored in another. This structured organization allows for efficient data retrieval and management.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Scalability: As the Goodreads user base grows, so does the amount of data it needs to handle. Databases are designed to manage large volumes of data and can be scaled up as needed. This allows Goodreads to support its growing user base without compromising on performance or efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Data Integrity: Databases also ensure data integrity, meaning that the data remains accurate and consistent across the platform. This is crucial for maintaining user trust and providing reliable book recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  Data Security: User data, including personal details and reading histories, needs to be stored securely. Databases provide mechanisms to protect this data, including access controls, backups, and encryption.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  Querying Capabilities: Databases allow complex queries to be executed on the data. This is how Goodreads can provide personalized book recommendations, find similar books, or allow users to search for books based on various criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "From the perspective of users, the use of databases by Goodreads enhances their experience on the platform. It enables them to browse through a vast, well-organized library of books, receive personalized recommendations, and connect with other readers seamlessly and efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our examples, we're using a small subset of the data that Goodreads might actually use. But even with this small dataset, you can see how SQL and databases allow us to extract useful information and insights, manipulate the data, and generate reports. And remember, the full Goodreads platform would have even more tables and data, giving them a lot more to work with and a lot more power to provide useful features for their users."

        "## The Sci_Fi_Books Table\n",
        "\n",
        "Our database of science fiction books, represented as a single table called \"books,\" consists of several fields each representing a different facet of information about a book. Let's decode the structure:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   `firstPublishDate`: The date when the book was first published, represented as a TEXT data type.\n",
        "-   `publishDate`: The most recent publication date of the book, also a TEXT data type.\n",
        "-   `title`: The title of the book.\n",
        "-   `series`: The series the book belongs to, if any.\n",
        "-   `author`: The author of the book.\n",
        "-   `rating`: The average Goodreads rating of the book, given as a REAL number (a decimal number).\n",
        "-   `language`: The language of the book.\n",
        "-   `pages`: The number of pages in the book, represented as an INT (integer).\n",
        "-   `publisher`: The name of the publisher.\n",
        "-   `numRatings`: The total number of ratings the book has received on Goodreads, represented as an INT.\n",
        "-   `id`: A unique identifier for each book, serving as the PRIMARY KEY for our database.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the things you'll notice is that the data is a mix of different types, including TEXT, REAL, and INT. And remember, not every field will have data -- sometimes, there will be null values, which means that no data is available for that particular field for a specific book.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this chapter, we will embark on a journey to explore this data more thoroughly. We will start by reviewing basic SQL commands and operations, then move onto the powerful aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, and AVG that allow us to extract meaningful insights from data. We will also dive into how to organize and filter data using GROUP BY and HAVING."

        "Subqueries are powerful tools in SQL that allow you to perform multiple levels of data manipulation in a single query. They are beneficial and sometimes necessary in the following situations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Sequential Filtering: When data needs to be filtered in a certain sequence, subqueries are incredibly helpful. For example, when you need to first calculate an aggregate over the entire dataset and then use that calculation to filter the data (like our examples for finding books with the maximum number of ratings).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Cross-Row Calculations: Subqueries can be used to make calculations that require values from multiple rows. For example, calculating the difference between a value in a single row and an aggregate value calculated over a group of rows (like the difference from the average rating in our examples).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Complex Filtering: The `IN` operator can work with subqueries to filter data based on complex conditions. This is particularly useful when the condition involves a list of values that is dynamically generated from data (like finding books from publishers who have published more than a certain number of books).\n",
        "\n",
        "While subqueries are powerful, they can also lead to issues that should be considered:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Performance: Subqueries can be slow, especially on large datasets. This is because the database must execute the subquery (potentially many times) before it can execute the outer query. Each execution of the subquery may involve reading and processing a large amount of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Readability: SQL queries with subqueries can become difficult to read and understand, especially if they are nested multiple levels deep. This can make it harder to debug the query or to modify it later.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Alternatives: In many cases, a subquery can be replaced with a JOIN or an aggregate function, which can be more efficient and easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, while subqueries are an advanced feature of SQL that can enable more complex data manipulations, they should be used judiciously. Always consider if there's a simpler or more efficient way to get the same result before resorting to a subquery."

        "## Case Study: How Do Sites Like Goodreads And Amazon Get Their Book Data?\n",
        "\n",
        "In the age of information, data is often referred to as the new oil. Platforms like Goodreads and Amazon stand as towering examples of how data can be harnessed to drive innovation, enhance user experience, and create a competitive edge. The acquisition, storage, and utilization of data by these platforms are not just technical feats but also raise significant ethical and legal considerations. This case study aims to unravel the intricate web of data handling by Goodreads and Amazon, shedding light on the methods, implications, and challenges involved. We begin by delving into the first critical question: How do Goodreads and Amazon acquire data?\n",
        "\n",
        "While Amazon (and Goodreads, which is owned by Amazon) don't reveal their exact algorithms, they almost certainly rely on some combination of the following.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  *User Profiles:* Both Goodreads and Amazon create detailed user profiles that include information such as name, email address, preferences, and more. This data is often voluntarily provided by users during account creation or profile customization.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  *Browsing Habits:* By employing cookies and tracking technologies, these platforms monitor the pages visited, the time spent on each page, and the links clicked. Amazon, for instance, keeps track of the products viewed by a user, forming a pattern that reveals preferences and interests.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  *Purchase History:* Amazon meticulously records every purchase made by a user. This includes not only what was bought but also when, how often, and in what combinations. This data is vital in understanding buying behaviors and trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  *Reviews and Ratings:* Goodreads, being a platform dedicated to books, relies heavily on user reviews and ratings. These insights help in understanding individual tastes and the overall reception of a book or author.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  *Third-Party Integrations:* Sometimes, data is acquired through integrations with other platforms or services. For example, Goodreads allows users to link their account with Facebook, thereby accessing additional data such as friends' reading lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  *Behavioral Tracking:* Beyond mere clicks and views, sophisticated algorithms track user behavior, such as how a user scrolls, hesitates, or even the path their mouse takes. This granular data can reveal subconscious preferences and decision-making processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you can see, the acquisition of data by Goodreads and Amazon is a multifaceted process that goes beyond mere \"passive\" collection. It's an orchestrated effort that involves understanding, predicting, and influencing user behavior. The data thus acquired becomes the foundation for numerous features and services that define the modern online experience. The ethical considerations and technological prowess involved in this process make it a subject worthy of deep exploration and understanding."

        "### Data Storage\n",
        "The storage of data within large digital platforms such as Amazon and its subsidiary Goodreads is a complex task that requires a multifaceted approach. One of the primary methods employed is the use of **relational databases**, such as Amazon Aurora. This MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database is designed for the cloud, providing efficient performance by automatically dividing and replicating data across multiple locations. Goodreads, being part of Amazon, likely leverages similar relational database technologies to manage structured data, such as user profiles and basic book information.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to relational databases, **NoSQL databases** play a significant role in handling unstructured or semi-structured data. Amazon's DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database, is utilized for key-value and document data structures. Its design allows for high availability and seamless scaling, making it suitable for various purposes within Amazon's ecosystem, including storing shopping cart information and managing high-traffic data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The vast scale of data handled by Amazon and Goodreads necessitates the use of **cloud and distributed systems**. These systems allow data to be stored across multiple servers or locations, providing essential scalability, redundancy, and accessibility. Amazon leverages its own cloud platform, **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, to run both relational and NoSQL databases. Services within AWS, such as Amazon S3 for object storage and EC2 for scalable computing resources, enable the efficient management of data across the entire Amazon family of services, including Goodreads. AWS is, in fact, among the world's largest provider of cloud services and many, many websites (such as Netflix) physically \"live\" on Amazon servers that are distributed across the globe.\n",
        "\n",
        "The integration of relational databases, NoSQL databases, and cloud/distributed systems within Amazon and Goodreads illustrates a sophisticated approach to data storage. It reflects a strategic alignment of technologies tailored to specific needs and challenges, ensuring that data is not only stored efficiently but is also accessible and resilient. This complex architecture underscores the importance of data as a vital asset in the digital age, and the thoughtful consideration given to its management within leading technology companies."

        "### Ethical Concerns\n",
        "The collection and use of data by Amazon and other **FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netfix)** companies has been a topic of heated debate over the last few years. Some main concerns include:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Consent and Transparency.** The collection of large amounts of user data raises fundamental questions about consent. Are users fully aware of what data is being collected, how it's being used, and with whom it might be shared? Transparency in data practices is essential, but often, the complexity of data operations and the use of lengthy, unclear terms of service can obscure true understanding. For example, when a user signs up for a service, they may be presented with a dense legal document that hides the true nature of data collection. The ethical obligation to ensure **informed consent** is a central concern, and it requires that companies make their practices clear and understandable to the average user.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Bias and Discrimination.** Algorithms that drive personalization and targeted advertising can inadvertently reinforce biases or lead to discrimination. If an algorithm is trained on biased data, it may perpetuate or even worsen those biases. Consider a recommendation system that might favor certain authors, genres, or products based on biased historical data. If the data reflects a preference for male (or white) authors, the algorithm might continue to recommend books by white men, leading to a lack of diversity in recommendations.  Philosophically, however, it raises profound questions about how we value different voices and perspectives. Are women's voices being marginalized not just in literature but in society at large? Is the algorithm merely reflecting a deeper bias, or is it actively contributing to the perpetuation of inequality?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Security.** With the collection of sensitive information comes the ethical responsibility to protect that data. Security breaches can have devastating consequences for individuals, ranging from financial loss to personal harm. Imagine a scenario where a person's medical records are leaked, leading to embarrassment or even blackmail. Ensuring robust security measures and being transparent about potential risks is an essential aspect of ethical data handling. Companies must not only implement strong safeguards but also communicate openly with users about the risks and protections in place.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Amazon's case, this is especially important, given the fact that they store not only their own data (with hundreds of millions of customers), but also that of many other large companies.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Environmental Impact.** The storage and processing of large amounts of data require significant energy resources, contributing to the environmental impact of data centers. Ethical considerations extend to the environmental stewardship of these operations, including energy efficiency and the sourcing of renewable energy. For instance, a data center that relies on coal power contributes to air pollution and climate change, whereas one powered by wind or solar energy has a much smaller environmental footprint. The ethical dimension here is not merely a matter of compliance with regulations but a broader responsibility to consider the long-term health of our planet.\n"
