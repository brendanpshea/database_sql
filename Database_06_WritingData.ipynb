        "\n",
        "In this chapter, we dive into the task of writing data to SQL tables, a fundamental operation in database management. We explore the use of the INSERT INTO statement to add new rows of data to tables, both for single-row and multiple-row insertions. By working with a sample database based on Rolling Stone's Greatest Albums of All Time, we illustrate the process of creating tables, defining constraints, and populating them with data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The chapter also covers important topics related to data manipulation, such as handling constraint violations, auto-incrementing primary keys, and using subqueries in INSERT statements. We discuss the differences between deleting data using the DELETE statement and dropping entire tables with DROP TABLE.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, we introduce the concepts of \"soft delete\" and the UPDATE statement for modifying existing data. We explore the use of triggers to automatically execute specific actions in response to database events and demonstrate how to implement logging mechanisms using triggers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we go beyond SQL and explore database scripting using Linux scripts and various programming languages. We discuss the benefits of automating database tasks and leveraging the power of scripting for data insertion, manipulation, and maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of writing data to SQL tables, handling constraints, and utilizing advanced techniques for data manipulation and automation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Learning Outcomes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Understand the process of creating tables and defining constraints in SQL.\n",
        "2.  Learn how to insert single and multiple rows of data into tables using the INSERT INTO statement.\n",
        "3.  Recognize and handle constraint violations during data insertion.\n",
        "4.  Utilize auto-incrementing primary keys for efficient data insertion.\n",
        "5.  Employ subqueries in INSERT statements for dynamic data insertion.\n",
        "6.  Differentiate between deleting data with DELETE and dropping tables with DROP TABLE.\n",
        "7.  Implement \"soft delete\" functionality to retain historical data.\n",
        "8.  Modify existing data using the UPDATE statement.\n",
        "9.  Create triggers to automate actions based on database events.\n",
        "10. Implement logging mechanisms using triggers for auditing and monitoring purposes.\n",
        "11. Explore database scripting using Linux scripts and various programming languages.\n",
        "12. Understand the use of Object-Relational Modeling (ORM) tools to interact with databases.\n",

        "-   The `Album` table has an `AlbumID` column as the primary key. The `Title` column is marked as `NOT NULL` to ensure that every album has a title. We have a foreign key `ArtistID` that references the `ArtistID` column in the `Artist` table, establishing a relationship between albums and artists. The `ReleaseYear` and `Genre` columns provide additional details about each album.\n",
        "-  We have specified that the primary keys (`ArtistID` and `AlbumID`) are both `NOT NULL` and `AUTOINCREMENT`. This means they cannot be left blank and that, if they are left blank, SQL will assign the next available integer to them.\n",
        "-   We include **check constraints** in both tables to enforce certain conditions. In the `Artist` table, we ensure that the `Founded` year is between 1900 and 2023. Similarly, in the `Album` table, we check that the `ReleaseYear` is within the same range.\n",

        "\n",
        "As we've seen, the **`DELETE FROM`** command is used to remove rows from a table. This operation can be selective or comprehensive. For example, if you only want to delete rows that meet certain criteria, you use a **`WHERE`** clause with your **`DELETE`** statement. Without a **`WHERE`** clause, **`DELETE`** will remove all rows in the table, but importantly, the table's structure remains untouched.  So, If you decide to remove all albums from the **`albums`** table, you simply omit the **`WHERE`** clause:\n",

        "DELETE FROM Albums;\n",
        "```\n",

        "This action clears all data from the **`albums`** table but keeps its structure intact for future use. You can still add new albums to it or modify its structure later.\n",
        "\n",
        "One significant aspect of **`DELETE`** operations is that they are logged row by row in the database's transaction log. This means each row deletion is recorded, allowing for the possibility to undo the deletions if the operation is part of a transaction. However, this logging can make **`DELETE`** operations slower when dealing with a large number of rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **`DROP TABLE`** command, in contrast, is much more drastic. When you execute a **`DROP TABLE`** statement, you remove the entire table from the database. This includes not just the data but the table's structure, its columns, indexes, and any constraints defined on it.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, if you decide that the **`artists`** table is no longer needed and you want to erase it entirely from the database, you would use:\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "DROP TABLE Artists;\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Executing this command means the **`artists`** table is deleted. The table, along with all its data and structure, is permanently removed from the database. Unlike **`DELETE`**, **`DROP TABLE`** does not log individual row deletions because it doesn't process each row; it removes the table as a whole. This makes **`DROP TABLE`** a fast operation but with the significant caveat that it is typically irreversible through standard SQL commands. Once a table is dropped, you cannot simply undo the action unless you have backups or specific database recovery tools in place."

        "\n",
        "In the previous section, we explored how to insert data from CSV files into a database using Linux scripts, specifically Bash. This is just one example of database scripting. In this section, we will expand our understanding of database scripting and explore different languages that are commonly used for this purpose.\n",

        "### Client-Side vs. Server-Side Scripting\n",
        "\n",
        "When it comes to database scripting, there are two main approaches: client-side scripting and server-side scripting.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Client-Side Scripting**: Client-side scripting refers to scripts that run on the client machine, such as a user's computer. These scripts interact with the database by sending requests to the database server and processing the responses. Client-side scripting is commonly used for tasks like data analysis, reporting, and automated data entry.\n",
        "2.  **Server-Side Scripting**: Server-side scripting, on the other hand, involves scripts that run directly on the database server. These scripts have direct access to the database and can perform tasks like data manipulation, database maintenance, and automated backups. Server-side scripting is often used for tasks that require high performance or need to be scheduled and executed on the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Popular Languages for Database Scripting\n",
        "\n",
        "While SQL is the standard language for interacting with databases, there are several other languages that are commonly used for database scripting. Let's take a look at a few of them:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Bash**: Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a Unix shell and command language. It is the default shell on many Linux distributions and is widely used for scripting and automation. Bash scripts can be used to interact with databases, execute SQL commands, and perform file operations, as we saw in the previous section.\n",
        "2.  **Python**: Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language that has extensive support for database operations. With libraries like SQLite3, MySQL Connector, and psycopg2 (for PostgreSQL), Python scripts can connect to databases, execute SQL queries, and manipulate data. Python's readability and simplicity make it a popular choice for database scripting.\n",
        "3.  **PowerShell**: PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework developed by Microsoft. It is commonly used in Windows environments for scripting and administration tasks. PowerShell provides cmdlets (pronounced \"command-lets\") for interacting with databases, such as `Invoke-Sqlcmd` for executing SQL queries and `Import-Csv` for importing data from CSV files.\n",
        "\n",
        "These are just a few examples of the languages used for database scripting. Other languages like Perl, Ruby, and JavaScript (with Node.js) can also be used depending on the specific requirements and environment. In the next section, we'll take a short look at one application involving Python."

        "\n",
        "In **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, an **object** is a fundamental concept that represents a distinct entity with its own set of attributes and behaviors. Objects are used to model real-world entities or abstract concepts in a software system, providing a way to organize and structure code by grouping related data and behavior into a single unit. This \"Object model of data\" (very) common way of organizing data in many modern programming languages, including Java, Javascript, C++, and Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of a music database, an object could represent a song, encapsulating attributes such as title, artist, album, and duration. These **attributes** define the state of the song object, while **methods** can be added to perform specific operations related to the song, such as playing or displaying its information. This is contrast to a table `song' in a relational database, which could store data, but which would not have any \"methods\" (instead, we interact with the data using SQL).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** is a technique that bridges the gap between the object-oriented paradigm (great for programming!) and the relational database model (great for storing data!). It allows developers to interact with databases using objects and object-oriented principles, rather than writing raw SQL queries.  Common tools for ORM include **Hibernate** and **Ebean** (both for the Java programming language), the **Entity Framework** (for C#), and SQLAlchemy (for Python--see below).\n",
        "\n",
        "**SQLAlchemy** is a popular and feature-rich ORM library for Python. It provides a set of tools and abstractions for working with databases in an object-oriented manner, supporting various database backends such as SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more.  With SQLAlchemy, you define Python classes that represent database tables, and the ORM takes care of mapping those classes to the corresponding tables in the database. Each class becomes a mapped entity, and instances of those classes represent individual rows in the table.\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  It starts by importing the necessary modules from SQLAlchemy: `create_engine`, `Column`, `Integer`, `String`, `Float`, `sessionmaker`, and `declarative_base`.\n",
        "2.  It configures logging to display information about the database operations.\n",
        "3.  It creates a connection to an SQLite database named \"songs.db\" using `create_engine()`. The `logging_name` parameter is set to \"myengine\" to identify the specific engine instance in the logs.\n",
        "4.  It creates a session factory using `sessionmaker()`, which is bound to the database engine. This factory will be used to create sessions for interacting with the database.\n",
        "5.  It creates a base class for declarative models using `declarative_base()`. This base class will be used to define the database models.\n",
        "6.  It defines a `Song` class that inherits from the base class. The `Song` class represents a table named \"songs\" in the database and has the following columns:\n",
        "    -   `id`: An integer column serving as the primary key.\n",
        "    -   `title`: A string column for the song title.\n",
        "    -   `artist`: A string column for the artist name.\n",
        "    -   `album`: A string column for the album name.\n",
        "    -   `duration`: A float column for the song duration.The `__repr__()` method is defined to provide a string representation of the `Song` object.\n",
        "7.  Finally, it creates the tables in the database using `Base.metadata.create_all(engine)`. This statement generates the necessary SQL statements to create the \"songs\" table based on the defined `Song` class.\n",
        "\n",
        "The output you see is the logging information generated by SQLAlchemy. It shows the SQL statements being executed to check the existence of the \"songs\" table and create it if it doesn't exist. The output indicates that the table was successfully created with the specified columns.\n",
