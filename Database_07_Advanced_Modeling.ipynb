        "# Advanced Modeling - Unfurling the Magic of Normalization and Subclass-Superclass Relationships\n",
        "### Brendan Shea, PhD\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to the next stage our journey into the magical realm of database design and modeling. You've journeyed through the basics of database fundamentals and elementary modeling. Now, we take you further into the world of advanced modeling techniques, shining a light on the intricacies of normalization and subclass-superclass relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this chapter, we will draw upon the enchanting world of J.K. Rowling's Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to guide our exploration. Using a comprehensive example of Hogwarts' enrollment data, initially stored as a simple spreadsheet, we will illustrate how it can be methodically transformed into a robust, efficient database model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process of normalization, developed by Edgar F. Codd, will be introduced as our essential tool for removing redundancies and improving the structural integrity of our database. We'll discover the importance of achieving various 'normal forms', helping to prevent the calamitous effects of data anomalies and inconsistencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "From the Great Hall to the classrooms of Hogwarts, we will encounter the ubiquitous presence of relationships in our data. Building upon your understanding of elementary relationships, we'll delve into the concept of subclass-superclass relationships, the very cornerstone of object-oriented database models. Drawing from the diverse personalities within Hogwarts, we'll see how these relationships play a pivotal role in creating a flexible and expressive database.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding how to model these complex relationships correctly and implement appropriate constraints will be vital. They are the keys to ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and relevancy of the data housed within our database.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout the chapter, we'll also touch upon concepts such as multi-valued attributes, transitive dependencies, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, and more. We will consider the role of denormalization and indexing in database design, essential topics in the advanced design of databases.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this chapter, you'll not only have a comprehensive understanding of these advanced modeling techniques but also see their application in real-world contexts, making you equipped to tackle complex database design problems. So, let's journey together into the fascinating world of normalization and subclass-superclass relationships, weaving together the enchanting stories of Hogwarts with the practical magic of database design."

        "\n",
        "This data structure (known as a \"flat file\"), although straightforward and simple to use, has several inherent issues from a database design perspective:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. *No obvious primary keys:* No single attribute uniquely identifies a record in the spreadsheet. For instance, 'Student Name' may seem a likely candidate, but there's always a possibility of having two students with the same name.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. *Redundant data:* The spreadsheet includes repeated information, such as 'Courses Enrolled' and 'Extra-Curricular Clubs', which can lead to anomalies and inconsistencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. *Multi-valued attributes:* Some attributes, like 'Courses Enrolled' and 'Extra-Curricular Clubs', can have multiple values for a single student, which is problematic in a database context.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. *Lack of structure for complex data:* The current format does not adequately handle complex relationships. For example, how do we handle course assignments for different teachers, or track a student's year level as it changes over time?\n",
        "\n",
        "In this chapter, we'll take this unnormalized spreadsheet and transform it into a well-structured, efficient database model, capable of supporting Hogwarts in managing its magical student body effectively. We will apply normalization techniques and identify subclass-superclass relationships, addressing each issue present in the initial spreadsheet. By the end, the spreadsheet's transformation into a database will reveal the powerful magic of advanced database design techniques. Let's step into this enchanting journey!"

        "## Why Normalize?\n",
        "Normalizing data is like organizing a big, messy closet. Imagine you have a closet where you've thrown in clothes, shoes, hats, scarves, books, and even some snacks. Now, if you want to find your blue sweater or your favorite book, it's going to be quite a challenge, right? You'll have to sift through everything else to get what you need. Now imagine if you took some time to organize this closet, putting clothes in one area, books on a shelf, snacks in a corner, and shoes neatly lined up on the floor. It will be much easier to find what you're looking for, and there's less chance of pulling out a snack when you're looking for a hat!\n",
        "\n",
        "This is pretty much what normalization does to data in a database. When data is not normalized, information can be scattered across various tables or can be repeated in many places. This can lead to a lot of problems:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Redundancy:** Just like our messy closet example, unorganized data can lead to unnecessary duplication. This not only takes up more storage space but can also lead to inconsistencies. Imagine if Hogwarts kept the house points in each student's record. If they update it for one student and forget to do it for others, it can lead to confusion.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Update Anomalies:** When data is repeated, updating it can become a nightmare. Imagine a professor changes their office location. If their office location is stored in every course they teach, that's a lot of places to make one change! With normalization, we would store professor information in one table, and any changes only need to be made in one place.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Insertion and Deletion Anomalies**: Without normalization, adding or removing data can be tricky. What if a new student joins Hogwarts, but they haven't been assigned a house yet? Where would we store their information if we only had a table for each house? With a separate \"Students\" table, we can add the student immediately and update their house assignment later.\n",
        "\n",
        "Normalization, through its different forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, etc.), helps to solve these problems by dividing data into logical units where each piece of information is stored in one place."

        "*Normalization* is the process of structuring a relational database in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. Let's examine how we can apply normalization to our Hogwarts Enrollment Spreadsheet, starting with the first normal form (1NF), then progressing to the second normal form (2NF), and finally, the third normal form (3NF).\n",
        "\n",
        "### First Normal Form (1NF):\n",
        "\n",
        "The first normal form dictates that each column of a table must contain only **atomic (indivisible) values**, and there must be a primary key.\n",
        "\n",
        "To conform our spreadsheet to 1NF, we first need to eliminate **multi-valued attributes** (that is, attributes that contain multiple values, such as a list of multiple courses). We'll split \"Courses Enrolled\" and \"Extra-Curricular Clubs\" into separate rows. Additionally, we'll introduce a unique Student ID for each student, as it's possible to have two students with the same name (and so, student name should NOT be used a primary key).\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, our 1NF tables might look like this:\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  **\"The Key\"** This corresponds to the First Normal Form (1NF). In 1NF, each column of a table must contain only atomic (indivisible) values, and there must be a primary key. This means that there should be no duplicate rows, and each attribute (column) must hold a single value rather than a list of values. Thus, the \"Key\" part of the mnemonic refers to the uniqueness and singularity of the data in each row and column, which is defined by the primary key.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **\"The Whole Key\"** This corresponds to the Second Normal Form (2NF). 2NF dictates that every non-key attribute (field) must be functionally dependent on the whole key, meaning that all information in a table should pertain to the concept that the primary key represents. In particular, if the primary key is composite (made up of multiple fields), no non-key attribute should depend on only part of the composite key.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **\"Nothing But The Key\"** This corresponds to the Third Normal Form (3NF). The phrase \"Nothing but the Key\" refers to the rule that no non-key attribute should depend on other non-key attributes, only on the primary key. This is designed to eliminate transitive dependencies (where A depends on B, and B depends on C, leading to an indirect dependency of A on C).\n",
        "\n",
        "This mnemonic covers the first three normal forms, which are typically sufficient for most database normalization tasks. It's important to note, however, that there are further forms of normalization, including the Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF), Fourth Normal Form (4NF), and Fifth Normal Form (5NF), that deal with more specific and less common issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "However, there's a point where we may decide to \"stop\" normalizing. Higher levels of normalization (beyond 3NF) can lead to a very large number of small tables. This can make the database harder to understand and queries more complex. In some cases, it might even affect performance."

Essentially, we have a hierarchy where the Supertype sits at the top, and Subtypes represent categories or types of the Supertype.

Each of these areas would have its own submodel capturing the unique entities, attributes, and relationships relevant to that domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "When it comes to creating a comprehensive data model that encompasses the entirety of Hogwarts' operations, it's like piecing together a vast, intricate puzzle. Here are some steps and considerations involved in this process:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1\\. Identify Key Entities Across Submodels:\n",
        "\n",
        "In the heart of each submodel lie its defining entities and relationships. These form the core around which the submodel revolves. For example, in our Hogwarts Enrollment submodel, key entities included 'Students', 'Houses', 'Courses', and 'Clubs'. Similarly, the IT Services submodel had 'User', 'Student', 'Faculty', and 'Administrator' as central entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first step in our comprehensive modeling journey is to recognize these key entities from each submodel. Further, we need to spot entities that are common to multiple submodels. For instance, 'Students' appear prominently in both our Enrollment and IT Services submodels. They might also feature in other submodels like Course Management (as enrollees), Library Services (as borrowers), and Quidditch Match Records (as players or spectators).\n",
        "\n",
        "This step is critical as these common entities often serve as the link between different submodels, facilitating their integration into a larger, unified model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2\\. Reconcile and Merge Common Entities:\n",
        "\n",
        "Once common entities have been identified, the next task is to reconcile and merge them into a single, unified representation that can span across all submodels. This involves aligning attributes, constraints, and data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider 'Students' as an example. In the Enrollment submodel, we might have attributes like 'Student Name', 'Date of Birth', 'Guardian Name', 'House', etc. In the IT Services submodel, 'User Type' (with value 'Student'), 'Username', and 'Password' might be pertinent attributes for 'Students'. When merging these entities, we need to create a unified 'Student' entity that carries all these attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, the data types and constraints of these attributes should align. If 'Student Name' is a string in one submodel and an integer in another, such inconsistencies need to be resolved.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3\\. Link Related Entities:\n",
        "\n",
        "In a large institution like Hogwarts, entities from distinct submodels can often be interrelated. It's vital to identify these connections and represent them accurately in our comprehensive data model.  \n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, 'Professor' might be an entity in the Staff Payroll submodel, containing attributes like 'Salary', 'Pay Grade', etc. The same 'Professor' might also feature in the Course Management submodel, teaching various 'Courses'. Here, 'Professor' and 'Course' would be linked entities, and we would need to capture this relationship in our model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Such connections across submodels add a layer of realism to our model, illustrating the multifaceted roles entities can play in different contexts within the same system.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4\\. Implement Subtype/Supertype Structures If Needed:\n",
        "\n",
        "In our quest to build an inclusive data model, we might encounter entities that can be further subdivided based on certain characteristics. In such cases, implementing subtype/supertype relationships can provide a more granular and accurate depiction of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, in our IT Services submodel, 'Users' was a generic entity, a supertype that could be any individual with access to Hogwarts' IT system. However, we recognized that the different types of users - 'Students', 'Faculty', and 'Administrators' - each had distinct attributes that were not shared by the others.\n",
        "\n",
        "By implementing a subtype/supertype structure, we were able to create specific entities for each user type, each inheriting common attributes from the 'User' supertype, while also holding their unique attributes. This structure helped capture the complexities of the IT Services data more effectively and accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5\\. Review and Refine:\n",
        "\n",
        "The construction of an integrated model marks a significant milestone, but our work is far from over. Now, we must review this preliminary model to ensure its accuracy, efficiency, and comprehensiveness.\n",
        "\n",
        "During this review, we look out for redundancies and inconsistencies that may have slipped in during the merging process. For instance, if the 'Student' entity from the Enrollment submodel and the 'Student' subtype from the IT Services submodel contain duplicate attributes, such redundancy needs to be eliminated.\n",
        "\n",
        "We also check for missing elements - entities, attributes, or relationships - that might have been overlooked or newly recognized during the integration process. For example, we might realize that our model lacks an entity for 'School Supplies' when incorporating the 'Student Shopping' submodel, prompting us to add this entity and its corresponding relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "This review stage might necessitate several revisions, which could include adding new attributes or entities, modifying relationships, or restructuring parts of the model to better reflect Hogwarts' operations. It's a cycle of constant refinement, where we iteratively improve the model until it aligns seamlessly with the reality of Hogwarts' multifaceted operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Building a comprehensive data model for a system as complex as Hogwarts is an ambitious endeavor. It might encapsulate hundreds of entities and relationships, reflecting every facet of the school's operations from Quidditch Match Records to Potion Ingredient Inventory. The secret lies in methodically deconstructing this vast system into manageable submodels and then carefully integrating these submodels into a coherent, logical, and accurate representation of the entire Hogwarts data universe.\n"

        "\n",
        "The Ministry of Magic, the governing body of the wizarding world in Britain, is a complex organization with many departments and functions. One of its primary roles is to enforce the law and maintain security in the wizarding world. For this exercise, let's focus on creating a data model that captures some of the Ministry's key operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the following entities and their attributes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Department (DepartmentID, DepartmentName, Head, Budget)\n",
        "2.  Employee (EmployeeID, Name, DateOfBirth, Position, Salary, DepartmentID)\n",
        "3.  MagicalLaw (LawID, LawTitle, LawDescription, DepartmentID)\n",
        "4.  Violation (ViolationID, ViolationDescription, LawID)\n",
        "5.  Case (CaseID, EmployeeID, ViolationID, DateOpened, DateClosed, Status)\n",
        "\n",
        "And the following business rules:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   The Ministry has several Departments, each with a unique ID, name, head, and budget.\n",
        "-   Each Department employs many Employees, each with a unique ID, name, date of birth, position, salary, and an associated department.\n",
        "-   Each Department enforces several MagicalLaws, each with a unique ID, title, and description.\n",
        "-   Each MagicalLaw can be linked to several Violations, each with a unique ID and description.\n",
        "-   An Employee (who can be a 'Clerk', 'Auror', or 'Administrator') manages each Case, which tracks a specific Violation. A Case has a unique ID, an open date, a close date (if applicable), and a status.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, follow these steps to create a data model:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Part 1: Identify Entities and Attributes\n",
        "\n",
        "Start by listing each entity and its attributes. Note which attributes are unique (potential primary keys) and which attributes could be used to link entities (potential foreign keys).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Part 2: Define Relationships\n",
        "\n",
        "Define the relationships between entities. Use the business rules to guide you. For instance, a Department employs many Employees, indicating a one-to-many relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Part 3: Implement Subtype/Supertype Structures\n",
        "\n",
        "The 'Employee' entity could be further divided into subtypes based on the 'Position' attribute. Create a supertype for 'Employee' and subtypes for 'Clerk', 'Auror', and 'Administrator'. Each subtype would inherit common attributes from 'Employee' while holding unique attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Part 4: Reconcile and Merge Common Entities\n",
        "\n",
        "Examine all entities for potential overlap or redundancy. Ensure that each entity serves a unique purpose in the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Part 5: Construct the ER Diagram\n",
        "\n",
        "Use a tool like diagrams.net to create an ER diagram based on your data model. Make sure to accurately represent entities, attributes, relationships, and subtype/supertype structures. Your diagram should visually convey all the information outlined in the business rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you complete each step, keep in mind that data modeling is an iterative process. Review and revise your model as needed to ensure it accurately captures the Ministry of Magic's operations. Good luck!\n",

        "| Term | Definition |\n",
        "| --- | --- |\n",
        "| Update Anomaly | This is when changing data (like updating an address) in one part of the database doesn't automatically update the same data elsewhere. This can lead to inconsistencies. For example, if a student moves and the address is updated in the 'Student' table but not in the 'Guardian' table. |\n",
        "| Insertion Anomaly | This is when you can't add data to the database due to missing additional data. For example, you can't add a new course unless you also have a professor assigned to it. |\n",
        "| Deletion Anomaly | This is when removing data unintentionally deletes other useful data. For example, if you delete a 'Professor' record because they left Hogwarts, but it also removes all the courses they taught from the database. |\n",
        "| Atomic Value | This is a value that can't be broken down any further. For example, a student's full name could be broken down into first and last name, so it's not atomic. But a student's first name alone is atomic, because it can't be broken down without losing its meaning. |\n",
        "| Multi-Valued Attribute | This is an attribute that can have more than one value. For example, a student could be part of multiple clubs, like 'Quidditch Club' and 'Potion Club'. |\n",
        "| First Normal Form | This is a rule for organizing databases. A table is in this form if it doesn't have any groups of values in a single column, and each row is unique. For example, a student's club should not be a list in a single cell, but each club should be a separate row. |\n",
        "| Fully Dependent (Key) | This is when a piece of information relies completely on the primary key. For example, in a 'Courses' table, the 'Course Description' is fully dependent on the 'Course ID'. |\n",
        "| Second Normal Form |  A table that is in 'First Normal Form' AND all non-key columns depend on the whole primary key. For example, in a 'Course Registration' table with 'Course ID' and 'Student ID' as the primary key, the 'Grade' depends on the whole primary key, not just one part of it. |\n",
        "| Transitive Dependency | This is when one piece of information relies on another through a third piece of information. For example, a 'Course ID' could lead you to a 'Professor ID', which could lead you to a 'Department'. |\n",
        "| Third Normal Form | A table that is in 'Second Normal Form' AND there are no transitive dependencies. In other words, each non-key column must directly depend on the primary key, not on another column. |\n",
        "| Supertype | This is a broader category that includes more specific subtypes. For example, 'User' could be a supertype for the subtypes 'Student', 'Faculty', and 'Administrator'. |\n",
        "| Subtype | This is a more specific category within a larger supertype. For example, 'Quidditch Player', 'Book Club Member' could be subtypes of the supertype 'Student'. |\n",
        "| Overlapping (Subtype) | This is when a single item can belong to more than one subtype at the same time. For example, Harry Potter is both a 'Quidditch Player' and a 'Book Club Member'. |\n",
        "| Disjoint (Subtype) | This is when a single item can belong to only one subtype at a time. For example, a 'User' can be either a 'Student', 'Faculty', or 'Administrator', but not more than one at the same time. |\n",
        "| Mandatory (Subtype) | This is when every instance of a supertype must be an instance of some subtype. For example, if 'User' is a supertype, then every user must be classified as either a 'Student', 'Faculty', or 'Administrator'. |\n",
        "| Optional (Subtype) | This is when an instance of a supertype may or may not be an instance of any subtype. For example, if 'Club Member' is a supertype, a student might not be a member of any specific club subtype like 'Quidditch Club' or 'Potion Club'. |\n",
        "| isA | This is a term used to denote the relationship between a subtype and its supertype. For example, a 'Student' isA 'User', a 'Quidditch Player' isA 'Student'. It signifies that an object of the subtype is also an object of the supertype. |\n",
        "| ARC Relationship | A unique type of relationship in a database model where an entity is involved in multiple relationships, but only one of those relationships can exist at a time for each instance of the entity. |\n",
        "| Recursive Relationship | A relationship where an entity is related to itself; instances of the same entity are associated with each other. This often models hierarchical structures or mutual relationships. |\n",
        "| Barred Relationship | Used in Associative or Junction tables to manage many-to-many relationships between two entities. <br> In this scenario, the junction table holds foreign keys to each of the related entities and often contains additional information about the relationship itself. <br> Notation in ER diagrams typically includes a bar \\| |"
