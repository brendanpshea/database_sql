        "# Monsters of JSON\n",
        "### Brendan Shea, PhD\n",
        "In the ever-evolving digital world, data has become the lifeblood of modern technology. Every day, countless amounts of data are generated, processed, and exchanged across various systems and platforms. This data can come in a multitude of formats, and one of the most prevalent is JSON, short for JavaScript Object Notation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**JSON** is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others.\n",
        "\n",
        "This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to JSON, its structure, and its practical uses. We will delve into the essential details of JSON and how it fits into the broader landscape of data formats. We will also explore why JSON has gained such popularity in the realm of databases and data exchange.\n",
        "\n",
        "One such database that has embraced JSON is PostgreSQL. Known for its robustness and advanced capabilities, PostgreSQL offers substantial support for JSON, allowing developers to store, query, and manipulate JSON data efficiently. We will explore these features and provide a hands-on guide to interacting with JSON within the PostgreSQL environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "To bring these concepts to life, we will be using a fascinating case study throughout this chapter. We will work with a JSON dataset related to the world of Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), a popular fantasy role-playing game. This dataset contains detailed information about various monsters in the game, encoded in JSON format. This dataset not only serves as a practical example of real-world JSON data but also adds an element of fun and intrigue to our exploration of JSON.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of JSON, its importance, and how to work with it in PostgreSQL. So, prepare yourself for a journey into the realm of data, where monsters lurk in JSON format, and PostgreSQL is our tool of choice for taming them."

        "## What is JSON?\n",
        "\n",
        "JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a text-based data format that is designed to be human-readable and easy for computers to parse and generate. JSON originated from the JavaScript language, but it is a language-independent data format. It is often used for transmitting data in web applications, serving as an alternative to XML.\n",
        "\n",
        "JSON is built on two simple structures: objects and arrays/\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objects\n",
        "An **object** in JSON is an unordered set of **key-value pairs**, similar to a dictionary, a hash, or a record in other languages. Objects are enclosed in curly braces {}. A colon : separates the **keys** and the **values**, and a comma `,` separates the pairs. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "{\n",
        "  \"monsterName\": \"Fluffy Bunny\",\n",
        "  \"monsterType\": \"Beast\",\n",
        "  \"hitPoints\": 3,\n",
        "  \"abilities\": [\"Hop\", \"Nibble\", \"Cuteness Overload\"]\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "In this example, the object describes a somewhat unusual D&D monster, a \"Fluffy Bunny\" with abilities including \"Hop\", \"Nibble\", and \"Cuteness Overload\".\n",
        "\n",
        "### Arrays\n",
        "An **array** in JSON is an ordered list of values, similar to a list, a vector, or an array in other languages. Arrays are enclosed in square brackets [], and the values are separated by commas. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "[\n",
        "  \"Bumbling Beholder\",\n",
        "  \"Kind Kobold\",\n",
        "  \"Dancing Doppelganger\",\n",
        "  \"Jolly Jelly Cube\"\n",
        "]\n",
        "```\n",
        "In this example, the array includes a list of whimsical D&D monster names. The order of these monster names in the array can be important, depending on how the data is to be used."

        "## Why JSON is not Relational\n",
        "Relational databases and JSON structures have fundamentally different ways of representing and organizing data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a relational database, data is structured into tables, similar to a spreadsheet. Each table has a defined schema, which is a set of attributes (or columns), and each attribute has a specific data type. Each row in the table represents a single record, and each cell in the row represents a value for the corresponding attribute. Relationships can be defined between tables using primary and foreign keys, allowing for complex data models to be represented.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, JSON data is represented as a collection of key-value pairs (objects) or ordered lists of values (arrays). JSON objects do not have a predefined schema, meaning each object can have a different set of keys. Arrays and objects can be nested within each other, allowing for complex, hierarchical data structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "The differences between these two data structures have several implications:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  *Flexibility:* JSON is schema-less, meaning it can represent a wider variety of data structures compared to relational databases. It's easy to add new fields or nest data structures. However, this flexibility can lead to inconsistencies in data if not managed carefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  *Complexity of Relationships:* Relational databases excel at representing complex relationships between different entities (tables). In JSON, while it's possible to nest objects within each other to represent relationships, it's less straightforward to manage many-to-many or complex relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  *Data Integrity:* Relational databases provide strong data integrity through constraints, such as unique, primary key, and foreign key constraints. JSON does not inherently support these constraints, so data integrity must be managed at the application level.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  *Querying:* Relational databases have a powerful querying language (SQL) that supports complex queries, aggregations, and joins. Querying JSON data can be less straightforward and often requires parsing the JSON structure at the application level. However, some databases like PostgreSQL offer JSON functions and operators that make querying JSON data easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  *Storage and Performance:* Generally, relational databases are optimized for performance and can handle large volumes of data efficiently. JSON can be less efficient for large data volumes, especially when the JSON structures are complex and deeply nested. However, some modern databases have improved JSON storage and query performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of our D&D example, if we were to use a relational database, we might have separate tables for \"Monsters\", \"Abilities\", and \"Types\", and we would define relationships between these tables. With JSON, we could potentially store all this data in a single JSON object, with abilities and types nested within each monster. The best approach would depend on the specific requirements and complexity of our application."

        "## Why is JSON Used?\n",
        "JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, has found extensive usage in modern software development due to its lightweight nature and easy readability. Here are some of the practical uses of JSON:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  *Data Storage:* JSON is often used for storing data locally or remotely in a structured, human-readable format. For example, a web application might store user settings in JSON format for easy retrieval and update.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  *Data Exchange:* JSON is commonly used as the data format for sending data between a server and a web application, or between different parts of a web application. Its human-readable nature and wide support across different programming languages make it ideal for this purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  *Configuration Files:* JSON is often used to store configuration settings for web applications, desktop applications, servers, and more. These configuration files can be easily read and written by the application, and also easily understood and modified by humans.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  *Web APIs:* Most modern web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) use JSON as their communication format. When a web application makes a request to an API (for example, to fetch data), the API often sends back the response in JSON format, which the web application can then easily parse and use.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  *Database Operations:* Many NoSQL databases, like MongoDB, use JSON for storing and manipulating data. Even SQL databases, like PostgreSQL, now often include support for JSON data types, allowing for more flexible data models.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  *Frontend Frameworks:* Many modern frontend frameworks (like React and Vue.js) use JSON for handling data within the application.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of our Dungeons & Dragons example, a D&D game application might use JSON to store data about different monsters, characters, and game settings. The game might also fetch additional data from a D&D API, which sends back responses in JSON format. This JSON data can then be parsed and used by the application to enhance the gameplay experience."

When the creature is outside a body of water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes have passed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tail.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Melee Weapon Attack:&lt;/em&gt; +9 to hit, reach 10 ft. one target. &lt;em&gt;Hit:&lt;/em&gt; 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enslave (3/Day).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The charmed target is under the aboleth&#x27;s control and can&#x27;t take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the aboleth.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;, &#x27;CHA_mod&#x27;: &#x27;(+4)&#x27;, &#x27;CON_mod&#x27;: &#x27;(+2)&#x27;, &#x27;DEX_mod&#x27;: &#x27;(-1)&#x27;, &#x27;INT_mod&#x27;: &#x27;(+4)&#x27;, &#x27;STR_mod&#x27;: &#x27;(+5)&#x27;, &#x27;WIS_mod&#x27;: &#x27;(+2)&#x27;, &#x27;img_url&#x27;: &#x27;https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/0/11/1000/1000/636238825975375671.jpeg&#x27;, &#x27;Challenge&#x27;: 10, &#x27;Languages&#x27;: [&#x27;Deep Speech&#x27;, &#x27;Telepathy 120 ft.&#x27;], &#x27;Hit Points&#x27;: 135, &#x27;Armor Class&#x27;: 17, &#x27;Saving Throws&#x27;: [&#x27;CON +6&#x27;, &#x27;INT +8&#x27;, &#x27;WIS +6&#x27;], &#x27;Legendary Actions&#x27;: &quot;&lt;p&gt;The aboleth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below.

        "-   `->`: This operator is used to get a JSON object field by key. The result is a JSON object or array. For example, `data->'name'` would give us the name of the monster as a JSON object (as an \"element of a JSON array\" or \"value of the name field).\n",
        "\n",
        "-   `->>`: This operator is also used to get a JSON object field by key, but the result is text. For example, `data->>'name'` would give us the name of the monster as text.\n",

That is, it conformed to a pre-defined model or schema, much like how data in a relational database fits neatly into rows and columns within a table. However, with the advent of the web and later, the rise of social media, mobile applications, and IoT devices, the nature of data began to change dramatically.\n",

        "The web brought with it an explosion of data that was diverse, complex, and did not neatly fit into the tabular structure of traditional databases. In response to this challenge, **XML (eXtensible Markup Language)** emerged as a popular format for representing this semi-structured data.\n",
        "\n",
        "XML is a markup language that encodes documents in a human-readable and machine-readable format. It uses a tag-based structure, which allows for hierarchical data representation. Here's an example of what a DnD monster might look like in XML:\n",

JSON is a text-based data interchange format derived from JavaScript, but it is language-independent. As we've seen above, JSON structures data as collections of key-value pairs and arrays, allowing it to represent complex data structures in a straightforward way. It is also less verbose than XML and easier to work with in web applications, which often use JavaScript.\n",

        "While NoSQL databases brought flexibility and scalability, they often compromised on some features that were strengths of relational databases, particularly ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guarantees and the ability to perform complex queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "This led to the emergence of NewSQL databases. NewSQL databases sought to bring the best of both worlds: the scalability and flexibility of NoSQL databases and the ACID guarantees and SQL interface of traditional relational databases.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, Google Spanner and CockroachDB, popular NewSQL databases, leverage distributed architectures and advanced consensus algorithms to provide strong consistency at global scale, while also offering a familiar SQL interface for interacting with data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the journey from JSON to NoSQL and NewSQL reflects the evolving landscape of data storage and management. As we move from structured to semi-structured data, from single servers to distributed systems, and from rigid schemas to flexible data models, our tools adapt and evolve. Understanding this progression helps us appreciate why different databases exist and how to choose the right one based on our specific needs."

        "## Traditional RDBMSs Respond to the NoSQL and NewSQL Movement\n",
        "\n",
        "The rise of NoSQL and NewSQL databases, while significant, did not spell the end for traditional relational database management systems (RDBMSs). In fact, it spurred them to evolve and adapt to the changing landscape of data storage and management. Let's explore how prominent RDBMSs like Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL have responded to these shifts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Embracing Semi-Structured Data\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the major ways that RDBMSs have adapted is by incorporating support for semi-structured data. Recognizing the growing importance of JSON, XML, and other semi-structured formats, these systems have introduced new features and data types to handle them.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, PostgreSQL introduced a JSON data type in version 9.2, and enhanced it with the JSONB type in version 9.4, which allows for binary storage of JSON documents. MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server have also introduced similar functionality. These features allow developers to store and query JSON data in a manner similar to NoSQL databases like MongoDB, while still retaining the benefits of a relational model where it is appropriate.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Scaling with the Cloud\n",
        "\n",
        "The advent of cloud computing has also had a profound impact on RDBMSs. As data volume grew and scalability became increasingly important, these systems needed to find ways to distribute data across multiple servers and even multiple data centers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most major RDBMS vendors now offer cloud-based versions of their systems, such as Amazon RDS for MySQL and PostgreSQL, Microsoft Azure SQL Database, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database Service. These cloud-based systems provide a range of benefits, including easy scalability, automated backups, and high availability.\n",
        "\n",
        "### NewSQL Features\n",
        "\n",
        "Even the NewSQL movement, with its emphasis on combining the best of the SQL and NoSQL worlds, has found echoes within traditional RDBMSs. For example, MySQL introduced the InnoDB Cluster feature, which provides high-availability and scalability features akin to those found in NewSQL databases.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why RDBMSs Remain Dominant\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite the growing popularity of NoSQL and NewSQL databases, RDBMSs continue to hold a dominant position in the industry. There are several reasons for this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  *Maturity:* RDBMSs have been around for decades, and they are mature, stable, and reliable. They have been tested by time and have proven their worth in a wide range of applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  *ACID Guarantees:* RDBMSs provide strong ACID guarantees, which are crucial for many business applications. While some NoSQL databases offer tunable consistency models, the strict consistency provided by RDBMSs is often necessary to ensure data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  *SQL:* SQL is a powerful and expressive language for querying and manipulating data. Despite the rise of NoSQL, the SQL language remains a de facto standard for interacting with data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  *Ecosystem and Skills:* There is a vast ecosystem of tools and resources built around RDBMSs, and a large pool of developers and administrators skilled in their use.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, while NoSQL and NewSQL databases have brought important innovations to the field of data management, traditional RDBMSs have also evolved to meet the same challenges. The choice between these systems often depends on the specific needs of the application and the skills of the development team. The key is understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each, and knowing when to use which."

        "| JSON | Short for \"Javascript Object Notation.\" A lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. For instance, `{ \"name\":\"Charles\", \"age\":30, \"city\":\"Rochester\" }` is a simple JSON document. |\n",
        "| JSON: Objects | Structures in JSON that are an unordered collection of key-value pairs, enclosed by curly brackets `{}`. In the JSON document `{ \"name\":\"Charlette\", \"age\":30, \"city\":\"Rochester\" }`, the entire document is a JSON object. |\n",
        "| Key | A string in JSON that identifies a certain value. Keys are always strings and are the first component of a key-value pair. For instance, in the pair `\"name\":\"Christie\"`, `\"name\"` is the key. |\n",
        "| Value | In JSON, a piece of data that can be a string, number, boolean, null, object, or array. It is the second component of a key-value pair. In the pair `\"name\":\"Christie\"`, `\"Christe\"` is the value. |\n",
        "| JSON: Arrays | Ordered collections of values in JSON, enclosed by square brackets `[]`. For instance, in the JSON document `{\"numbers\": [7, 2, -3, 4, 5]}`, the list `[7, 2, -3, 4, 5]` is a JSON array. |\n",
        "| API | Stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. APIs often output data in JSON format. For example, a weather API might return data about the current weather in a JSON format. |\n",
        "| Semi-structured data | A form of data that does not conform to the tabular structure of data models associated with relational databases or other forms of data tables, but nonetheless contains tags or other markers to separate semantic elements. JSON and XML are examples of semi-structured data. |\n",
        "| JSONB (Postgres) | A binary format in PostgreSQL for storing JSON data, which allows for indexing and advanced querying. For instance, a PostgreSQL table might have a column of type JSONB to store JSON documents. |\n",
        "| ->> (Postgres Operator) | An operator in PostgreSQL that is used to get a JSON object field by key. The result is text. For example, in a query `SELECT data->>'name' FROM monsters;`, `->>` is used to get the `\"name\"` field as text. |\n",
        "| NoSQL | A type of database that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data which is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. For example, MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. |\n",
        "| MongoDB | A NoSQL database program that uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. For instance, in MongoDB, a collection of users might be stored as JSON-like documents, each representing a user with fields like `name`, `email`, `password`, etc. |\n",
        "| NewSQL | A class of relational database management systems that seek to provide the scalability of NoSQL systems for online transaction processing (OLTP) workloads while maintaining the ACID guarantees of a traditional database system. For example, Google's Spanner database is a NewSQL database. |"
