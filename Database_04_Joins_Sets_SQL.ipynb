        "# Getting Tables Together With Joins and Sets\n",
        "### Brendan Shea, PhD\n",

        "Welcome to Chapter 4. In this part of the book, we'll learn about joins and set operations using SQLite. We'll use a database called movies.sqlite, which is based on data from IMDB and includes movie, actor, director, person, and Oscar data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- First, we'll show you the database schema for movies.sqlite. This is a guide to how the data is organized. We'll also display the first five rows of each table, so you can see what the data looks like.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Next, we'll explain what an entity-relationship diagram is. It's a way of showing how different tables in a database are connected. It helps you understand the database's structure. We'll also discuss VARCHAR and CHAR, which are different kinds of data types, and explain how they compare to TEXT.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Then, we'll talk about how tables relate to each other, using something called cardinalities. We'll go over \"join\" tables, like the Actor and Director ones, and explain their importance in connecting data. We'll also explain what primary keys are and why they're necessary in each table.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- The main part of this chapter is about joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT (OUTER) JOIN, and CROSS JOIN. We'll show you how each one works, give examples, and explain when you might want to use them.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Finally, we'll go over set operations: UNION, DIFFERENCE, EXCEPT, and INTERSECT. These are methods you can use to combine or compare results from different SQL queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember, the key to understanding databases is practice. Don't be afraid to experiment and make mistakes. That's how you'll learn. Now, let's get started on joins and set operations!\n"

        "### Why ER Diagrams?\n",
        "An **Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram** (like the one you see here) is a visual tool that allows us to model and represent the relationships between different entities in a database. An 'entity' could be anything we want to store information about, such as movies, people, or awards in our movies.sqlite database.\n",
        "\n",
        "In an ER diagram, **entities** (roughly, classes of things corresponding to tables) are usually represented as rectangles, while **relationships** are shown as lines or arrows connecting these rectangles. These relationships illustrate how data in one entity relates to data in another. For example, in our movies.sqlite database, a relationship exists between the 'Movie' and 'Person' entities through the 'Actor' and 'Director' entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "This diagram used a simplified version of **Crow's foot notation**, which is a type of ER diagram where relationships are displayed with symbols that somewhat resemble a bird's footprints (hence the name). This notation is particularly helpful in showing the cardinality of relationships, or in other words, how many instances of one entity relate to instances of another entity.\n",
        "\n",
        "In crow's foot notation, we look at the **connectors** at the end of lines to determine the relationships between entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   A `1` (also indicated with `|`) stands for 'exactly 1'.\n",
        "-   A crow's foot (`<` or `>`) symbol stands for 'many'.\n",
        "-  A circle (`O`) on a line represents \"optional\" (we don't have any of these in this diagram).\n",
        "\n",
        "So, for example, consider the line between 'Movie' and 'Director'. Since there is a crow's foot (\"many\") next to the Director box and a 1 next to the Movie box, this means there is a **many-to-one** relationship between directors and movies: Every director can direct many movies, but each movie (at least for the purposes of this database can have only one director). Many-to-one relationships form the \"heart\" of relational databases, since **one-to-one relationships** are often encoded as \"attributes\" of tables (for example, a Person's relationships with their own name) while **many-to-many** relationships (for example, the relationship between Persons and Movies--a person can be in many movies and a movie can have many persons) can't be represented without breaking them down into multiple many-to-one (or one-to-many) tables (as we've done here with Director and Actor).\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Role of ER Diagrams in Database Design and Interpretation\n",
        "\n",
        "ER diagrams play a crucial role in both the design and interpretation of databases:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Design: When designing a database, ER diagrams help us to visualize the structure and relationships in our database before we start creating it. By mapping out entities and their relationships, we can see and adjust our database's design more easily. It helps ensure we accurately represent the data and relationships we want to capture.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Interpretation: ER diagrams can also be handy tools for understanding existing databases. They provide a clear, visual representation of the structure of a database, making it easier to understand the relationships between different entities. This understanding is key when it comes to effectively querying a database.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember, a well-designed ER diagram can save you time and trouble. It gives you a clear roadmap of your database, helps prevent errors, and makes the database easier to work with, whether you're the one who created it or not."

        "The general form of a CROSS JOIN SQL statement looks like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
        "FROM table1\n",
        "CROSS JOIN table2;\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "A CROSS JOIN returns the Cartesian product of rows from both tables. Essentially, it combines every row of the first table with every row of the second table. If the first table has 'n' rows and the second table has 'm' rows, the result will be a table with n*m rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "The CROSS JOIN is a key theoretical concept, as it represents the maximum possible combination of rows between two tables. Other types of joins can be viewed as a filtered version of the CROSS JOIN where only the relevant rows are returned based on the specified condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's illustrate this with a small example. Suppose we have the following 'Actor' and 'Movie' tables:\n",
        "\n",
        "'Actor' Table:\n",

        "| actor_id | name |\n",

        "| 101 | The Godfather |\n",
        "\n",
        "If we were to apply a CROSS JOIN to these two tables:\n",

        "```\n",

        "As you can see, every actor is paired with every movie, regardless of whether they actually have any connection. This result might seem nonsensical in real-world applications, and that's why the CROSS JOIN is not used as often as the other types of joins in practical data analysis tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, understanding the CROSS JOIN is valuable, because it serves as a baseline for understanding the more commonly used types of joins. For INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and others, you can think of starting with the CROSS JOIN's complete set of combinations and then eliminating the rows that don't meet the specific conditions of the join. The CROSS JOIN provides the complete 'universe' of potential combinations from which these other, more selective joins draw their results."

        "1.  `SELECT P.name, COUNT(A.actor_id) as \"# of Movies\" FROM Actor A JOIN Person P ON P.id = A.actor_id`: This section of the query is the main part, it is retrieving the name of the actor from the `Person` table and the number of movies each actor has participated in from the `Actor` table. The `COUNT(A.actor_id)` command is used to count the number of movies each actor has participated in.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  `JOIN`: The `JOIN` statement is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them. In this case, the related column is the `id` field in the `Person` table and `actor_id` field in the `Actor` table. Essentially, this is how we link an actor's name with their roles.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  `GROUP BY A.actor_id, P.name`: This clause is used to group the result-set by one or more columns. It's used in collaboration with aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, etc., to group the result set by one or more columns. Here it groups the result by `actor_id` and `name`, meaning it will aggregate the count of movies for each unique actor and their corresponding name.\n",

The `HAVING` clause works like a WHERE clause, but for aggregated data. The subquery `(SELECT A1.actor_id FROM Movie M1 JOIN Actor A1 ON A1.movie_id=M1.id WHERE M1.name LIKE '%Star Wars%')` returns a list of actor IDs who have played in a movie with 'Star Wars' in its title. The `IN` operator checks whether a value is within a set of values returned by a subquery. So, `HAVING A.actor_id IN ...` is used to include only the actors who were in a 'Star Wars' movie. The other part of the `HAVING` clause `AND COUNT(A.actor_id) > 5` is used to filter the actors who have played in more than 5 movies."
