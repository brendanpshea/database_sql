        "## What is Conceptual Modeling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Conceptual modeling is the first step in designing a database. It involves understanding the data requirements without focusing on technical details. Think of it as sketching a rough draft before creating a detailed blueprint. This process helps us determine what data needs to be stored and how it should be organized to reflect real-world scenarios accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Determining Business Rules\n",
        "\n",
        "**Business rules** are the guidelines that define how data can be created, stored, and modified within the database. They ensure that the data accurately represents the business operations. In Wednesday Addams' Web Shop, several business rules need to be established to ensure the database supports the shop's operations effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Examples of Business Rules\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Each order must be linked to a specific customer. This means that every time an order is created, it must reference an existing customer in the database.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Each product should have a stock count that decreases with each sale. This ensures that the database keeps track of inventory accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Each customer must have a unique email address to prevent duplicate accounts and ensure efficient communication.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  Orders should have a status (e.g., pending, shipped, delivered) to track their progress through the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "These business rules help us understand the structure and constraints needed for the database.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Identifying Entities and Attributes\n",
        "\n",
        "The next step in conceptual modeling is identifying the entities and their attributes. An entity is a distinct object or thing in the system, and an attribute is a property or characteristic of an entity.\n",

        "#### Example Entities and Attributes for Wednesday's Web Shop\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Customer\n",

        "2.  In a **one-to-many relationship**, a single instance of one entity is associated with multiple instances of another entity. For example, each customer can place multiple orders, but each order is placed by only one customer. Here, the relationship between `Customer` and `Order` is one-to-many.\n",
        "3.  In a **many-to-many relationship**, multiple instances of one entity are associated with multiple instances of another entity. For example, each order can contain multiple products, and each product can be part of multiple orders. This relationship cannot be directly represented in a relational database and usually requires an intermediary entity to resolve it. We'll discuss this in the next section.\n",

For example, a student may not be enrolled in any courses yet, but they still exist in the system. Optional relationships are depicted with an open circle or using the notation `|o`-- for one-to-many optional relationships.\n",
        "\n",

A `crow's foot` (three branching lines) represents \"many,\" indicating that one instance of an entity can be related to many instances of another entity. For example, the `crow's foot` on the `ORDER` side of the \"places\" relationship shows that one customer can place many orders.\n",

If there is no circle, it means the relationship is mandatory from the entity with the `crow's foot`. For example, in the \"places\" relationship, the absence of a circle on the `CUSTOMER` side means that each order must be placed by a customer, making it a mandatory relationship from the order's perspective.\n",

        "Unlike many SQL databases that enforce strict datatype constraints, SQLite uses a concept called **type affinity**. This means that while a column can have a ASNI-standard datatype declared, SQLite is flexible in terms of what it accepts for storage. For instance, you can store a string in a column declared as INTEGER.\n",

        "Underneath the hood, SQLite stores all data (regardless of datatype) in one of five **storage classes**:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   NULL: The value is a NULL value.\n",
        "-   INTEGER: The value is a signed integer.\n",
        "-   REAL: The value is a floating-point number.\n",
        "-   TEXT: The value is a text string, stored using the database encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16BE, or UTF-16LE).\n",
        "-   BLOB: The value is a blob of data, stored exactly as it was input.\n",
        "\n",
        "Enterprise-scale RDBMs (Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, Postgres) have a more complex way of storing date. However, so long as you write SQL code using ANSI-standard SQL, it should work with ANY of them.\n"
