### 7. Views and Common Table Expressions
[Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/database_sql/blob/main/Database_07_Views.ipynb)  
Enhance your data retrieval techniques with views and Common Table Expressions (CTEs). Using data from Spotify and Rolling Stone's 500 greatest albums, you'll learn to create reusable query structures and simplify complex queries. This chapter also touches on data governance, ensuring you understand the importance of data quality and management.

### 8. Database Performance and Transactions
[Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/database_sql/blob/main/Database_08_IndexesTransactions.ipynb)  
Optimize your database operations by exploring indexes, transactions, and query analysis. With a "Gotham National Bank" theme, you'll dive into the world of database performance tuning. Learn essential skills in database monitoring and reporting to keep your databases running smoothly and efficiently.

### 9. Introduction to PostgreSQL
[Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/database_sql/blob/main/Database_09_PokemonAndPostgres.ipynb)  
Evolve your database skills by transitioning from SQLite to PostgreSQL. Catch 'em all as you explore new data types, stored procedures, and window functions in this Pokemon-themed chapter. You'll gain hands-on experience with a professional-grade database system, preparing you for real-world database management scenarios.

### 10. Database Security
[Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/database_sql/blob/main/Database_10_DatabaseSecurity.ipynb)  
Defend your data kingdom with crucial database security concepts and practices. Set in the Mushroom Kingdom's Toad City Hospital, this chapter equips you with the knowledge to protect sensitive information and maintain data integrity. Learn to implement security measures that safeguard your databases from various threats.

### 11. Database Architecture: Design, Deploy, Test
[Open In Colab](https://github.com/brendanpshea/database_sql/blob/main/Database_11_DesignDeployTest.ipynb)  
Master the art of database deployment with the help of well-known cartoon characters. This chapter covers the entire database lifecycle, from development to production. Learn different deployment strategies and best practices to ensure smooth transitions and minimal downtime in your database projects.

### 12. Final Project
[Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/database_sql/blob/main/Database_12_FinalProject.ipynb)  
Put all your newly acquired skills to the test in this comprehensive final project. Design, create, populate, query, and optimize your very own database from scratch. This hands-on experience consolidates your learning and prepares you for real-world database challenges.

## Tools

Enhance your learning experience with our suite of interactive quiz tools designed to reinforce SQL concepts through practical exercises. These tools are integrated into the course chapters and provide hundreds of automatically graded SQL questions covering a wide range of topics, from basic `SELECT`, `CREATE`, `INSERT` statements to advanced concepts such as subqueries, JSON columns, and various types of JOINs.

### SQL DDL Quiz

**Overview:**  
An interactive tool focused on SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) statements. Execute DDL queries, receive immediate feedback, and compare your solutions with correct answers within a Google Colab environment. This tool supports the chapters by providing hands-on practice with creating and modifying database schemas.
