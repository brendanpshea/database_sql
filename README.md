**A Note on the Use of AI Tools.** These chapters were intitially developed as the “generative AI” explosion took off (staring with OpenAI’s GPT 3.0), and I’ve had fun experimenting with many of these tools—including successive versions of ChatGPT, Google Bard, Claude, Codey, CoPilot, and others—in helping to turn my (voluminous, but often unorganized) lecture notes into something resembling a proper book. My experience was these tools with these has been generally positive, and I think that they can someday do at least some of the work done by traditional editors and publishing houses (I say this as a former editor at an academic press!). I’m less convinced they are going to immediately replace the actual *writer* or *programmer*, though, as there’s still a fair amount of expertise (and effort!) into producing quality, meaningful output.
