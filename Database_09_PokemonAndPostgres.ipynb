        "## What is PostgreSQL? How Does it Differ from SQLite?\n",
        "\n",
        "PostgreSQL and SQLite are both relational database management systems that support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties and transactions. However, they have significant differences in their architectures, feature sets, and use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "**SQLite** is a lightweight, serverless, and self-contained database engine. It's ideal for small to medium-scale applications, embedded systems, or local data storage. SQLite stores the entire database as a single file on disk, making it easy to set up and manage. It's often used in mobile apps, desktop applications, and small websites.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, **PostgreSQL** is a full-featured, server-based RDBMS designed to handle large amounts of data and support multiple concurrent users. Its client-server architecture allows it to manage resources more efficiently and handle heavier workloads.\n",
        "\n",
        "When deciding between SQLite and PostgreSQL, consider the following factors:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Scalability**: As your application grows and the number of concurrent users increases, PostgreSQL's client-server architecture becomes crucial. It can handle a large number of simultaneous connections and efficiently manage resources. SQLite, being serverless, may struggle with high levels of concurrency and may not be suitable for applications with a large number of concurrent writers.\n",
        "2.  **Data Size and Distribution**: PostgreSQL is designed to handle large and massive datasets, even in the terabyte range. It offers features like table partitioning, which allows you to split large tables across multiple files or even servers, improving query performance and manageability. SQLite, while capable of handling moderately sized datasets, may not be the best choice for extremely large or distributed datasets.\n",
        "3.  **Advanced Features**: PostgreSQL offers a rich set of advanced features that become increasingly important as your application grows. These include:\n",
        "    -   **Strict Typing**: PostgreSQL enforces strict data typing, ensuring data integrity and reducing the chances of data inconsistencies. This becomes increasingly critical when there many \"writers\" to the database.\n",
        "    -   **Complex Queries**: PostgreSQL supports complex queries, including advanced joins, subqueries, and window functions, which are essential for handling sophisticated data retrieval tasks.\n",
        "    -   **Stored Procedures and Triggers**: PostgreSQL allows you to define stored procedures and triggers, enabling you to encapsulate complex business logic within the database itself. This can lead to better performance and maintainability.\n",
        "    -   **Extensibility**: PostgreSQL is highly extensible, allowing you to add custom data types, functions, and even programming languages. This flexibility becomes crucial as your application's requirements evolve.\n",
        "    - **Security and User Management**: Postgres has built-in support for things like encryption, user management, password hashing, and other security measures. SQLite, by contrast, relies on the surrounding \"application\" (written in Python, Java, C#, etc.) to handle these things. This can be become impractical as the numbers of users becomes large.\n",
        "4.  **Replication and High Availability**: As your application becomes mission-critical, you may need to ensure high availability and minimize downtime. PostgreSQL offers built-in replication features, such as streaming replication and logical replication, which allow you to create standby servers and distribute the workload. SQLite, being a serverless database, does not have built-in replication capabilities.\n",
        "5. **Available Resources.** Postgres requires more physical resources (processing power, disk space) and human resources (e.g., a trained database administrator) than SQLite. SQLite's dynamic typing can make database development and deployment quicker than Postgres's strict typing. (In fact, SQLite is often used to develop protoype databases, which can then be \"scaled up\" to Postgres or a similar RDBMS).\n",
        "\n",
        "While SQLite is a great choice for small to medium-sized applications, embedded systems, or local data storage, it may not be suitable for large-scale, high-concurrency, or mission-critical applications. In these cases, PostgreSQL's robustness, scalability, and advanced features make it the better choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, a large institution like a university or a financial organization would likely choose PostgreSQL over SQLite due to its ability to handle large amounts of data, support multiple concurrent users, and provide advanced features necessary for complex data management tasks."

        "| Data Type Category | Examples | Description |\n",
        "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
        "| Numeric Types | `INTEGER`, `BIGINT`, `SMALLINT`, `DECIMAL`, `NUMERIC`, `REAL`, `DOUBLE PRECISION`, `SERIAL`, `BIGSERIAL` | Whole numbers, fixed-point numbers, floating-point numbers, and auto-incrementing integers. |\n",
        "| Character Types | `CHAR(n)`, `VARCHAR(n)`, `TEXT` | Fixed-length and variable-length character strings. |\n",
        "| Date/Time Types | `DATE`, `TIME`, `TIMESTAMP`, `INTERVAL` | Stores date, time, timestamp, and interval values. |\n",
        "| Boolean Type | `BOOLEAN` | Stores a logical value of either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. |\n",
        "| Enumerated Type | `ENUM` | Defines a custom data type with a static set of values. |\n",
        "| Array Type | Any data type followed by `[]` | Represents an array of elements of the same type. |\n",
        "| UUID Type | `UUID` | Stores Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs). |\n",
        "| JSON and JSONB Types | `JSON`, `JSONB` | Stores JSON data as text or in a binary format. |\n",
        "| Hstore Type | `HSTORE` | Represents a key-value pair data type. |\n",
        "| Range Types | `INT4RANGE`, `TSRANGE`, `DATERANGE`, etc. | Represent a range of values, such as integers, timestamps, or dates. |\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are a few examples to illustrate the usage of some of these data types:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Enumerated Type:\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "CREATE TYPE mood AS ENUM ('sad', 'ok', 'happy');\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Array Type:\n",

        "CREATE TABLE scores (\n",
        "      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",

        "      grades INTEGER[]\n",
        "    );\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "When choosing data types for your database schema, consider factors such as data integrity, storage efficiency, and the nature of the data being stored. PostgreSQL's wide range of data types gives you flexibility and power in designing your database schema.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's worth noting that while SQLite also supports many of these data types, such as numeric, character, and date/time types, it lacks some of the more advanced types like arrays, UUIDs, and range types. PostgreSQL's extensive set of data types is one of the factors that make it a more versatile and feature-rich database system."

        "Again, much of the above INSERT statement should be familiar. However, if you look closely at the ways the researcher's passwords are handled, you'll notice something a bit different.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `password_hash` column stores the hashed version of the researcher's password. **Hashing** is a one-way process that converts the plain-text password into a fixed-size string of characters. The resulting hash is irreversible, meaning it is computationally infeasible to obtain the original password from the hash.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the `crypt` function is used along with the `gen_salt` function to hash the passwords. The `crypt` function applies a cryptographic hash function to the password, and the `gen_salt` function generates a random salt value using the Blowfish ('bf') algorithm. The salt is appended to the password before hashing, making it more resistant to rainbow table attacks and increasing the security of stored passwords.\n",
        "\n",
        "Storing hashed passwords instead of plain-text passwords is crucial for security. If the database is compromised, attackers would only have access to the hashed passwords, making it extremely difficult for them to retrieve the original passwords.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that while the example uses the `crypt` function for simplicity, in a production environment, it's recommended to use more secure and modern hashing algorithms specifically designed for password hashing, such as bcrypt, scrypt, or PBKDF2, which provide better protection against various types of attacks.\n",

        "## Stored Procedures in PostgreSQL\n",
        "\n",
        "In the world of Pokemon, trainers often have a set of routines they follow to care for their Pokemon. They may have a specific way of feeding them, training them, or even a special technique for battling. These routines help trainers manage their Pokemon effectively and consistently. Similarly, in the world of databases, we have stored procedures that allow us to encapsulate and reuse common tasks or complex operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What are Stored Procedures?\n",
        "\n",
        "A **stored procedure** is a precompiled collection of SQL statements and optional control-flow statements stored under a name and processed as a unit. It is a database object that performs a specific task or a series of tasks when invoked. Stored procedures are stored within the database itself and can be called or executed whenever needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stored procedures offer several benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  *Reusability*. Stored procedures can be called multiple times from different parts of an application, promoting code reuse and reducing duplication.\n",
        "2.  *Encapsulation*. Stored procedures encapsulate complex logic and SQL statements, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.\n",
        "3.  *Performance*. Since stored procedures are precompiled and stored in the database, they can execute faster compared to individual SQL statements sent from an application.\n",
        "4.  *Security*. Stored procedures can help enforce security by granting execute permissions to users without giving them direct access to the underlying tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Basic Syntax of Stored Procedures\n",
        "\n",
        "In PostgreSQL, you can create a stored procedure using the `CREATE PROCEDURE` statement. Here's the basic syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name(parameter1 datatype, parameter2 datatype, ...)\n",
        "AS $$\n",
        "BEGIN\n",
        "  -- Procedure logic goes here\n",
        "  -- SQL statements and control-flow statements\n",
        "END;\n",
        "$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's break down the syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   `procedure_name`: The name you give to the stored procedure.\n",
        "-   `parameter1`, `parameter2`, etc.: Optional input parameters that the procedure can accept. You specify the parameter name and its data type.\n",
        "-   `AS $$`: Indicates the start of the procedure body.\n",
        "-   `BEGIN` and `END`: Delimits the procedure body, which contains the SQL statements and control-flow statements.\n",
        "-   `LANGUAGE plpgsql`: Specifies the language used for the stored procedure, in this case, PL/pgSQL (Procedural Language/PostgreSQL).\n",
