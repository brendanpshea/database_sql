        "## Conceptual Design at the Covert Academy\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to the Covert Academy, the world's premier educational institution for aspiring secret agents! Our state-of-the-art facility is hidden beneath the streets of London and equipped with the latest in espionage technology. We offer a wide range of classes to train our students in the arts of surveillance, infiltration, disguise, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "To keep track of our students and classes, we need a well-designed database. Let's walk through the process of conceptual design for this database.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is Conceptual Design?\n",
        "\n",
        "Conceptual design is the first step in creating a database. It involves **formulating business rules**, which define how the database should work and what constraints it should have. It also involves creating a **preliminary list of entities and attributes**, which represent the key concepts and data elements in the system. Finally, it involves creating a **preliminary Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** to visually represent the entities and their relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Formulating Business Rules\n",
        "\n",
        "**Business rules** are concise, unambiguous statements that define or constrain some aspect of the database. They are derived through a combination of **descriptive processes**, such as interviewing stakeholders to understand their needs and requirements, and **normative processes**, which involve making decisions about how the system should work.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the Covert Academy, we have the following business rules:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Each **student** must be enrolled in at least one **class**, but may be enrolled in multiple classes.\n",
        "2.  Each **class** must have at least one **student** enrolled, but may have many students.\n",
        "\n",
        "To write effective business rules:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Keep them concise and unambiguous\n",
        "-   Ensure they are testable (you can determine if the system is complying with the rule)\n",
        "-   Involve all relevant stakeholders in formulating and reviewing them\n",
        "-   Prioritize them (some may be must-haves, others may be nice-to-haves)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Preliminary List of Entities and Attributes\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on our business rules, we can identify our preliminary **entities**, which are the key concepts or objects in our system, and their **attributes**, which are the data elements that describe each entity.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the Covert Academy, our entities and attributes are:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Student**\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Name\n",
        "-   Codename\n",
        "-   Nationality\n",
        "-   Specialization\n",
        "\n",
        "**Class**\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Name\n",
        "-   Description\n",
        "-   Instructor\n",
        "-   Location\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that at this stage, we don't include data types, identifier columns, or join tables. We're just focusing on the core entities and their key attributes."
