        "\n",
        "Welcome to the Covert Academy, the world's premier educational institution for aspiring secret agents! Our state-of-the-art facility is hidden beneath the streets of London and equipped with the latest in espionage technology. We offer a wide range of classes to train our students in the arts of surveillance, infiltration, disguise, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "To keep track of our students and classes, we need a well-designed database. Let's walk through the process of conceptual design for this database.\n",

        "### What is Conceptual Design?\n",
        "\n",
        "Conceptual design is the first step in creating a database. It involves **formulating business rules**, which define how the database should work and what constraints it should have. It also involves creating a **preliminary list of entities and attributes**, which represent the key concepts and data elements in the system. Finally, it involves creating a **preliminary Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** to visually represent the entities and their relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Formulating Business Rules\n",
        "\n",
        "**Business rules** are concise, unambiguous statements that define or constrain some aspect of the database. They are derived through a combination of **descriptive processes**, such as interviewing stakeholders to understand their needs and requirements, and **normative processes**, which involve making decisions about how the system should work.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the Covert Academy, we have the following business rules:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Each **student** must be enrolled in at least one **class**, but may be enrolled in multiple classes.\n",
        "2.  Each **class** must have at least one **student** enrolled, but may have many students.\n",
        "\n",
        "To write effective business rules:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Keep them concise and unambiguous\n",
        "-   Ensure they are testable (you can determine if the system is complying with the rule)\n",
        "-   Involve all relevant stakeholders in formulating and reviewing them\n",
        "-   Prioritize them (some may be must-haves, others may be nice-to-haves)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Preliminary List of Entities and Attributes\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on our business rules, we can identify our preliminary **entities**, which are the key concepts or objects in our system, and their **attributes**, which are the data elements that describe each entity.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the Covert Academy, our entities and attributes are:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Student**\n",

In our case, we'll be using the **relational model**, which organizes data into **tables** (also known as relations) with **rows** (also known as tuples) and **columns** (also known as attributes).\n",

        "In our conceptual model, we had a many-to-many relationship between **STUDENT** and **CLASS**. However, in the relational model, we can't directly represent many-to-many relationships. Instead, we need to introduce a **join table**.\n",
        "\n",
        "A join table is a table that breaks down a many-to-many relationship into two one-to-many relationships. It does this by having foreign keys to both of the original tables.\n",

        "-   A one-to-many relationship between **CLASS** and **ENROLLMENT**\n",
        "\n",
        "### Choosing Primary Keys\n",
        "\n",
        "Each table in our database needs a primary key. A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table. There are two main options for primary keys:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Natural Key**: A natural key is a key that uses one of the existing attributes of the entity. For example, we could use a student's email as the primary key for the STUDENT table. Natural keys can be convenient because they don't require an additional column. However, they can also be problematic if the natural key ever needs to change.\n",
        "2.  **Surrogate Key**: A surrogate key is an artificial key that is created specifically to be the primary key. It's usually a simple integer or a universally unique identifier (UUID). Surrogate keys are often preferable because they are guaranteed to be unique and they never need to change.\n",

        "### Defining a Primary Key\n",
        "\n",
        "To define a primary key for a table, you can use the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint. This can be done in two ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  As part of the column definition:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
        "        column_name datatype PRIMARY KEY,\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "If the primary key is composed of multiple columns (a composite key), you must use the second form and list all the columns in the primary key:\n",

        "#### Defining a Foreign Key\n",

        "```sql\n",
        "CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
