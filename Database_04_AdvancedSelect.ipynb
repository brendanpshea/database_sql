        "## Database Overview\n",
        "The \"Mario Brothers Plumbing\" database consists of six interconnected tables designed to manage a plumbing business:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Customers**: Stores customer information, including a JSON field for address.\n",
        "2.  **Employees**: Stores employee information, including job title and hire date.\n",
        "3.  **ServiceTypes**: Stores service type information, including name and description.\n",
        "4.  **Services**: Stores service information, including name, description, and price (DECIMAL).\n",
        "5.  **Orders**: Stores order information, including customer, employee, date, and total amount (DECIMAL).\n",
        "6.  **Order_Items**: Stores order item information, including order, service, and quantity.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Types: JSON and DECIMAL\n",
        "Two notable data types used in this database are JSON and DECIMAL.\n",
        "\n",
        "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that allows for flexible and structured data representation. It can store complex data types like objects and arrays. In this database, JSON is used to store customer addresses, as it provides a convenient way to store and retrieve structured address data without the need for separate address-related tables. Later in this chapter, we'll see how to use SQLite to query this data.\n",
        "\n",
        "DECIMAL is a data type used to store precise numeric values, with a specified precision and scale. It is suitable for storing monetary values, such as prices and total amounts, where exactness is crucial. In this database, DECIMAL(10,2) is used, allowing for prices and total amounts up to 99,999,999.99.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Relationships\n",
        "\n",
        "The tables in this database are related through one-to-many relationships, established using foreign key constraints:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Customers** and **Orders**: A customer can have multiple orders, but an order belongs to only one customer. This is a one-to-many relationship, with the `customer_id` foreign key in the Orders table referencing the `customer_id` primary key in the Customers table.\n",
        "-   **Employees** and **Orders**: An employee can handle multiple orders, but an order is handled by only one employee. This is a one-to-many relationship, with the `employee_id` foreign key in the Orders table referencing the `employee_id` primary key in the Employees table.\n",
        "-   **Orders** and **Order_Items**: An order can have multiple order items, but an order item belongs to only one order. This is a one-to-many relationship, with the `order_id` foreign key in the Order_Items table referencing the `order_id` primary key in the Orders table.\n",
        "-   **Services** and **Order_Items**: A service can be included in multiple order items, but an order item includes only one service. This is a one-to-many relationship, with the `service_id` foreign key in the Order_Items table referencing the `service_id` primary key in the Services table.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Sub-type Relationship\n",
        "\n",
        "In this database, Services are a **sub-type** of ServiceTypes. This means that each service belongs to a specific service type, and the service type provides a way to categorize and group related services.\n",
        "\n",
        "The sub-type relationship is encoded in the relational database using a one-to-many relationship between the ServiceTypes and Services tables. The `service_type_id` foreign key in the Services table references the `service_type_id` primary key in the ServiceTypes table. This relationship ensures that each service is associated with a valid service type and allows for efficient querying and data integrity maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using a sub-type relationship, the database can store common attributes of service types in the ServiceTypes table, while specific details of individual services are stored in the Services table. This design promotes data normalization, reduces data redundancy, and allows for easier management and extension of the service catalog."

        "## Case Study: Subqueries and Big O in the Mushroom Kingdom\n",
        "Welcome to the Mushroom Kingdom, where Birdo and Yoshi have taken up SQL programming in their spare time! As they dive into the world of databases, they quickly realize the importance of understanding query efficiency and performance. This is where Big O notation comes into play.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Introduction to Big O Notation\n",
        "Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. In the context of databases and SQL queries, Big O notation helps us analyze how the running time of a query changes as the size of the input data grows.\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"O\" in Big O stands for \"order of,\" and it describes the upper bound of the growth rate of a function. In simpler terms, it tells us how fast the running time of a query increases as the amount of data it processes increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some common Big O notations and their meanings:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   O(1): Constant time - The query's running time remains constant, regardless of the input size.\n",
        "-   O(log n): Logarithmic time - The query's running time grows logarithmically with the input size.\n",
        "-   O(n): Linear time - The query's running time grows linearly with the input size.\n",
        "-   O(n log n): Linearithmic time - The query's running time grows in a combination of linear and logarithmic factors.\n",
        "-   O(n^2): Quadratic time - The query's running time grows quadratically with the input size.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, let's look at some simple database queries and their corresponding Big O notations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example 1: Constant Time - O(1)\n",
        "\n",
        "Birdo has a query that retrieves a single record from the `Toads` table based on a specific `id`:\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "SELECT * FROM Toads WHERE id = 1;\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This query has a Big O notation of O(1) because it always retrieves a single record based on its **primary key**, regardless of the size of the `Toads` table. The running time remains constant. (Note: If this was something besides the primary key, this might be different)!\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example 2: Linear Time - O(n)\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "This query has a Big O notation of O(n), where n is the number of records in the `Toads` table. As the number of records grows, the running time of the query increases linearly.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example 3: Linearithmic Time - O(n log n)\n",
        "\n",
        "Birdo has a query that sorts the `Toads` table based on the `name` column:\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "SELECT * FROM Toads ORDER BY name;\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This query has a Big O notation of O(n log n) because sorting algorithms typically have a time complexity of O(n log n). The running time grows in a combination of linear and logarithmic factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example 4: Subquery with Quadratic Time - O(n^2)\n",
        "Birdo has a query that retrieves the names of all Toads who have collected more than the average number of Power Stars:\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "SELECT name\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this query, the subquery calculates the average number of Power Stars collected by all Toads. The outer query then compares each Toad's `num_power_stars` against this average. The subquery has a Big O notation of O(n^2) because\n",
        " 1. The \"inner query needs to scan the entire `Toads` table to calculate the average.  This is O(n),\n",
        " 2. The outer query also has a Big O notation of O(n) because it needs to compare each Toad's `num_power_stars` against the average.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, the overall Big O notation of this query is O(n * n) = O(n^2). This could be pretty slow with large datasets. After Birdo and Yoshi discuss it a while, they discover they could speed up this query with **common table expressions** which we will learn about later."

        "This query demonstrates a scenario where the use of nested subqueries can lead to a cubic time complexity, which can be very inefficient for large datasets. In such cases, it's essential to consider alternative approaches, such as optimizing the database schema, using joins instead of subqueries, or breaking down the query into smaller, more efficient parts.\n",
